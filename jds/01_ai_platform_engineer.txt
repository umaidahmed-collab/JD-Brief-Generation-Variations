About the job
The Mission 

You will take ownership of an existing AI-powered SaaS platform (D50 AI), stabilize it, make it production-ready, and ensure Division50 fully controls the code, infrastructure, and future development.

This is not a greenfield project.

This is not a "ticket-taking" role.

You will inherit:

an imperfect codebase,
partial documentation,
multiple third-party AI and telecom integrations,
and a founder who needs execution, not theory

If you enjoy untangling systems, understanding how things actually work, and turning chaos into something reliable, this role fits. If you need perfect specs, it doesn't.

What You'll Be Responsible For2. Infrastructure & Deployment3. AI Orchestration & Integrations

 Platform Ownership & Stabilization
Take full technical ownership of the D50 AI platform
Understand the existing architecture end-to-end: frontend, backend, AI orchestration, databases, integrations
Fix stability issues, broken flows, partial logic, and reliability gaps
Make the platform safe to onboard real users without things breaking
Own deployment and environments on AWS (or equivalent)
Ensure proper environment separation (dev / staging / production)
Set up monitoring, logging, and basic alerting
Optimize cloud costs so unit economics don't spiral

You will work hands-on with:

OpenAI (text + images)
ElevenLabs / Cartesia (voice generation)
Deepgram (speech-to-text)
HeyGen (video generation)
AI orchestration frameworks (Langflow or equivalent agent/workflow orchestration)

You don't need to invent new models. You need to:

wire them correctly,
manage failures,
handle retries,
and ensure predictable behavior

4. Telephony & Communication Systems

Own integrations with Twilio and Telnyx
Understand call flows, call states, retries, dispositions, recordings
Ensure calls, transcripts, recordings, and outcomes are logged correctly
Make sure AI caller behavior is reliable and debuggable

5. CRM & Campaign Logic

Maintain and improve the internal CRM logic:
leads
activities
call logs
email logs
campaign status
Ensure MongoDB schemas are clean, scalable, and documented
Ensure onboarding logic flows correctly into campaign creation, asset generation, and calling logic
6. Frontend Ownership

Maintain and improve the SaaS dashboard UI
Work with a React-based frontend (exact framework to be confirmed)
Fix UX-breaking issues that block onboarding or campaign setup
You don't need to be a designer, but things must work and make sense

7. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

Create real documentation as you go:
architecture overview
deployment steps
key workflows
integration points
Make the platform understandable to the next engineer, not just yourself

Requirements

Backend & Systems

Strong experience with Node.js / Python (at least one deeply)
Experience building and maintaining APIs
Comfortable with async systems, queues, retries, and failure handling

Databases

MongoDB (required)
Ability to design schemas that support CRM-style workflows and logs

Frontend

React (or similar modern JS framework)
Comfortable debugging production frontend issues

Cloud & DevOps

AWS (EC2, S3, basic networking, IAM)
Docker (or similar containerization)
CI/CD basics (GitHub Actions or similar)

AI / LLM Systems

Practical experience with OpenAI APIs
Understanding of prompt-driven systems and AI workflows
Experience with AI orchestration tools (Langflow, LangChain, or similar) is a big plus

Telephony / Real-Time Systems

Experience with Twilio, Telnyx, or similar
Understanding of call states, SIP concepts, webhooks, and event-driven systems

Nice To Have (Not Required)

Experience with SaaS billing systems
Experience stabilizing MVPs into production systems
Experience inheriting messy codebases
Experience working directly with founders

Benefits

Fully remote
 No micromanagement
