Absolutely! To create a truly comprehensive, recruiter-friendly brief, I’ll need to clarify a few items first. Here are the questions I’d ask you to ensure nothing is missed and that the brief is crystal clear for a non-technical, external recruiter:

---

**Questions for You (the Hiring Manager):**

1. **Team Structure & Reporting:**  
   - Who does this role report to? (Title and a brief description of their role)
   - How big is the current FP&A team? Any direct reports for this role?
   - Who are the main internal stakeholders (e.g., business unit leaders, C-suite, accounting)?

2. **Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have:**  
   - Which qualifications or experiences are absolutely required, and which are just preferred?
   - Are there any deal-breakers (e.g., must have public company experience, must have worked with certain tools)?

3. **Industry Experience:**  
   - Is experience in the technology or SaaS industry mandatory, or just a bonus?

4. **Technical Skills:**  
   - Which systems/tools are you using today? (ERP, FP&A tools, visualization tools)
   - How much hands-on experience is needed with each tool (e.g., must be an expert in Excel, but only basic knowledge of Tableau is fine)?

5. **Remote/Hybrid Expectations:**  
   - Is relocation required or will you consider candidates outside Austin who are willing to relocate?
   - How many days per week are required in the office?
   - Is there any flexibility for remote work?

6. **Compensation:**  
   - Is the salary range firm, or is there flexibility for exceptional candidates?
   - Is the bonus and equity structure negotiable?

7. **Interview Process:**  
   - What does the interview process look like (steps, assessments, who’s involved)?
   - Are there any case studies or technical assessments?

8. **Key Success Factors:**  
   - What would make someone successful in this role in the first 6-12 months?
   - Any specific challenges the new hire should be prepared for?

9. **Company Culture:**  
   - How would you describe the team and company culture?
   - What type of personality or work style fits best?

10. **Other Notes:**  
    - Any companies or backgrounds you particularly like or dislike?
    - Anything else the recruiter should know to help them “sell” the opportunity?

Once you answer these, I’ll create a detailed, plain-English recruiter brief that covers everything your external recruiter needs to know.

**If you’re ready, please answer the above questions. If you want to proceed with the brief based only on the JD, let me know and I’ll draft it now.**
