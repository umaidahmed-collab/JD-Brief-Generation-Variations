Absolutely! To create a truly comprehensive and recruiter-friendly brief, I’ll need to clarify several points so that even a non-technical, external recruiter can understand exactly what you’re looking for, the context of your company, and how to spot the right candidates.

**Please answer the following questions to help me build the best possible brief:**

---

### 1. **About Your Company**
- What does your company do? (Industry, products/services, size, culture)
- What is your company’s mission or vision?
- What is unique or exciting about your company that would attract candidates?
- Is the company remote, hybrid, or office-based? Where is the office located?

---

### 2. **About the Team and Reporting Structure**
- What team will the QA Engineer join? (e.g., product team, engineering team)
- Who will the QA Engineer report to? (Job title, e.g., QA Manager, CTO)
- How big is the current QA or engineering team?
- Are there other QA Engineers on the team, or will this be the first/only one?
- What is the team culture like? (e.g., collaborative, fast-paced, supportive)

---

### 3. **About the Role**
- Is this a new role or a replacement? If a replacement, why did the previous person leave?
- What are the top 3-5 priorities for this person in the first 6-12 months?
- What does success look like in this role?
- Are there any specific projects or products the QA Engineer will work on?
- What is the typical day-to-day like for this role?
- What are the working hours and expectations around overtime or flexibility?

---

### 4. **Must-Have Skills & Experience**
- Are there any specific tools, technologies, or programming languages that are absolutely required? (e.g., must have Selenium, or is Cypress/JMeter also okay?)
- Is experience with certain types of testing (e.g., automation, performance, security) more important than others?
- Is experience in a particular industry (e.g., fintech, healthtech) required or preferred?
- Are there any certifications that are mandatory, or just “nice to have”?
- Is a degree required, or is equivalent experience acceptable?

---

### 5. **Nice-to-Have Skills & Experience**
- Are there any additional skills or experiences that would make a candidate stand out?
- Are there any “bonus” skills that are not required but would be valuable (e.g., experience with cloud platforms, API testing, CI/CD pipelines)?

---

### 6. **Soft Skills & Culture Fit**
- What kind of personality or soft skills are you looking for? (e.g., proactive, detail-oriented, team player)
- Are there any red flags or traits you want to avoid?
- What are the communication expectations (e.g., must be fluent in English, need to work with global teams)?

---

### 7. **Logistics & Compensation**
- What is the salary range and benefits package?
- Is this a permanent/full-time role, contract, or temporary?
- Is sponsorship or relocation available for candidates outside your area?
- What is the interview process (steps, who will they meet, any assessments)?

---

### 8. **Other Important Information**
- Are there any deal-breakers or must-avoid backgrounds?
- Are there any companies or industries you’d prefer to target or avoid?
- Anything else you want the recruiter to know to help them find the right candidates?

---

**Once you provide answers to these questions, I will create a detailed, plain-English recruiter brief that explains everything in simple terms, defines any technical concepts, and gives your recruiter all the context they need to find the best candidates.**
