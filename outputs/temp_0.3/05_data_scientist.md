Absolutely! To create a truly comprehensive, recruiter-friendly brief, I will need to clarify a few things with you first. This will ensure the brief is clear, accurate, and tailored to your needs. Here are the questions I’d like you to answer before I create the final brief:

---

### 1. **Company Context & Culture**
- **How would you describe the company culture in simple terms?** (e.g., fast-paced, collaborative, innovative, etc.)
- **What are the company’s core values or mission?**
- **What is the size of the company and the Risk Analytics team?**
- **Who does this role report to?** (title/position)
- **Are there any direct reports or is this an individual contributor role?**

### 2. **Role Context**
- **Why is this position open?** (e.g., new role, backfill, team expansion)
- **What are the top 3 business priorities for this role in the first 6-12 months?**
- **What does success look like in this role after 1 year?**

### 3. **Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have**
- **Which requirements are absolutely non-negotiable?** (e.g., specific years of experience, certain technologies, industry background)
- **Which skills or experiences are “nice to have” but not required?**

### 4. **Technical Skills – Plain English**
- **Are there any specific machine learning techniques or tools that are essential?** (e.g., must have hands-on experience with XGBoost, or is general ML experience sufficient?)
- **Is experience with financial data or regulated environments a must, or can strong ML skills from other industries suffice?**
- **Is experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) required, or is familiarity enough?**
- **Are you open to candidates who have not worked with all the listed ML frameworks, or do they need hands-on experience with each?**

### 5. **Soft Skills & Communication**
- **What kind of communication is most important?** (e.g., presenting to executives, writing clear documentation, mentoring, etc.)
- **Is prior experience mentoring or leading others required, or just a plus?**

### 6. **Remote Work & Location**
- **Is the role open to candidates anywhere in the US, or are there any time zone or state restrictions?**
- **Is there any travel expected?**

### 7. **Compensation & Benefits**
- **Is the compensation package flexible for the right candidate, or is it fixed?**
- **Are there any unique benefits or perks you want highlighted?**

### 8. **Interview Process**
- **What does the interview process look like?** (e.g., number of stages, types of interviews, technical assessments)
- **Are there any “dealbreakers” that would immediately disqualify a candidate?**

### 9. **Candidate Red Flags**
- **Are there any backgrounds or experiences that are NOT a fit?** (e.g., only academic experience, no production ML experience, etc.)

### 10. **Additional Notes**
- **Anything else you want the recruiter to know to help them “sell” the role or screen out the wrong candidates?**

**Once you answer these questions, I’ll create a detailed, plain-English recruiter brief that explains everything in simple terms, defines any technical concepts, and gives your recruiter all the context needed to find the best candidates.**
