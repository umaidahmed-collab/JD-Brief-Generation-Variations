Absolutely! To create the most effective and comprehensive recruiter brief, I need to clarify a few points with you first. This will help ensure the brief is clear, accurate, and leaves no room for confusion for your external recruiter.

**Please answer the following questions:**

---

### 1. **About the Hospital & Team**
- What is the culture like in the Emergency Department (ED)? (e.g., collaborative, high-pressure, supportive, teaching-focused)
- How large is the ED nursing team? What is the nurse-to-patient ratio?
- Are there any unique aspects of your ED compared to others (e.g., specific patient demographics, trauma volume, teaching environment)?
- Who does this nurse report to (e.g., ED Nurse Manager, Charge Nurse)?
- What is the onboarding and orientation process like for new hires?

### 2. **Role Details & Must-Haves**
- Is ED (Emergency Department) experience absolutely required, or will you consider strong acute care nurses from other departments?
- Are you open to candidates who need to relocate, or do you prefer local candidates?
- Is there a specific state RN license required, or will you consider candidates eligible for endorsement?
- Are you open to new graduates if they have strong clinical rotations in the ED?
- Is the BSN requirement strict, or will you accept an Associate Degree Nurse (ADN) if they commit to earning a BSN?
- Are there any certifications that are non-negotiable at the time of hire (e.g., BLS, ACLS, PALS), or can some be obtained after starting?
- What is the process for obtaining TNCC within 6 months—does the hospital provide support for this?

### 3. **Work Schedule & Flexibility**
- Are both day and night shifts available, or is there a preference?
- How are shifts assigned—self-scheduling, fixed, or rotating?
- How often are on-call shifts required?
- Is overtime common or expected?

### 4. **Compensation & Benefits**
- Is the sign-on bonus paid out all at once or in installments?
- Is relocation assistance capped at a certain amount?
- Are there any other unique benefits (e.g., childcare, commuter benefits)?

### 5. **Candidate Qualities & Soft Skills**
- What personal qualities are most important for success in your ED? (e.g., calm under pressure, teamwork, adaptability)
- Are there any deal-breakers or red flags to watch for in candidates’ backgrounds?
- Is bilingual ability (Spanish) a strong preference or just a “nice to have”?

### 6. **Interview Process**
- What does your interview process look like? (e.g., phone screen, in-person interview, panel, skills assessment)
- Are there any specific scenarios or questions you always ask?
- How quickly do you aim to move from interview to offer?

### 7. **Other Details**
- Are there any hospital policies or requirements the recruiter should know about? (e.g., COVID-19 vaccination, background checks, drug screening)
- Do you sponsor visas for this role?
- Is there anything else you want the recruiter to emphasize or avoid when presenting candidates?
