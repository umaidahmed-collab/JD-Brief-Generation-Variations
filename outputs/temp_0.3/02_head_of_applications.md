Absolutely! To create a comprehensive, easy-to-understand recruiter brief, I’ll need to ask you several clarifying questions to ensure the brief is tailored for a non-technical, external recruiter. Please answer as many as you can—your responses will help me make the brief as clear and actionable as possible.
