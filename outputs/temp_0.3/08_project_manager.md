Absolutely! To create a truly comprehensive, recruiter-friendly brief, I’ll need to clarify a few things and gather additional details to ensure your external recruiter can understand the role, context, and requirements—even if they have no technical or industry background.

**QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY BEFORE WRITING THE BRIEF:**

1. **Company Culture & Values**
   - How would you describe BuildRight’s culture (e.g., collaborative, fast-paced, traditional, innovative)?
   - What are the company’s core values or mission?
   - What makes someone successful at BuildRight?

3. **Project Types & Clients**
   - What are the most common types of projects (e.g., hospitals, schools, office buildings)?
   - Who are the typical clients (private companies, government, universities)?
   - Are there any specific clients or project types this person will focus on?

5. **Technical Tools & Software**

   - What does the interview process look like (steps, who is involved)?
   - Are there any assessments, case studies, or reference checks required?
