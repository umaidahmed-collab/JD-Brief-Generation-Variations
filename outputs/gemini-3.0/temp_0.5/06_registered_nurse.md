To create a truly "bulletproof" brief for an external recruiter who doesn't know the medical world, I need to bridge the gap between clinical requirements and the reality of the job.

Below is a list of **clarifying questions** I need you to answer. After you provide these details, I will synthesize everything into the final, comprehensive brief.

### Part 1: Questions to Sharpen the Brief

**1. The "Why" and the Culture:**
*   **Why is the position open?** (e.g., Is the hospital expanding? Is there high turnover? Is this a backfill for a promotion?)
*   **How would you describe the "vibe" of this specific ED team?** (e.g., "A tight-knit family that grabs drinks after shifts," or "A high-performance, military-style precision unit.")
*   **What is the biggest challenge a nurse will face in *this* specific hospital?** (e.g., High volume of uninsured patients, long wait times, or very intense trauma cases?)

**2. The Ideal Candidate "Persona":**
*   **The "Must-Have" vs. "Ideal":** If I find a nurse with 5 years of ICU (Intensive Care) experience but 0 years of ED experience, would you talk to them?
*   **The "DNA":** If you could clone your best nurse, what are the 3 personality traits they have? (e.g., "Unshakeable calm," "Sarcastic sense of humor," "Obsessive about organization.")
*   **The "No-Go's":** Are there specific hospitals or types of backgrounds that *never* work out here?

**3. Selling the Role (The "Hook"):**
*   **What is the #1 reason a nurse would leave a competitor to come here?** (Is it the teaching hospital status? The $15k bonus? The specific tech you use?)
*   **Career Path:** Where does a nurse go after this? Do you promote from within to Charge Nurse or Management?

**4. Process & Logistics:**
*   **The Interview Process:** What are the steps? (e.g., 30-min phone screen with HR -> 1 hour Zoom with Unit Manager -> In-person peer interview).
*   **Speed:** How fast can you move? If the recruiter finds a "rockstar" today, how soon can they be interviewed?
*   **On-boarding:** How long is the orientation/training period for a new hire?

### Part 2: Preliminary "Plain English" Brief (Draft)
*While you answer the questions above, here is how I am beginning to structure the brief to ensure your recruiter understands the "Medical Jargon."*

#### **The Role at a Glance**
We are looking for an **Emergency Department (ED) Nurse**. Think of this person as a "Medical First Responder" inside the hospital. They are the first line of defense for anyone walking through the door—from someone with a broken finger to someone having a heart attack.

#### **What is a "Level I Trauma Center"? (The Context)**
For a non-medical recruiter: This is the "Major Leagues." A Level I center is the highest level of hospital. It means we take the most "critical" patients (gunshot wounds, major car accidents, etc.). It is fast, loud, and intense. **We need someone who doesn't panic.**

#### **Jargon Buster (The Technical Terms Explained)**
*   **ESI (Emergency Severity Index):** This is just a 1 to 5 scale used to "triage" (sort) patients. 1 = Dying right now; 5 = Needs a prescription refill. The nurse needs to know how to spot the "1s" immediately.
*   **Epic EMR:** This is the software/computer system where they log everything. It’s like the "Salesforce" of hospitals. If they know it, they’ll start much faster.
*   **ACLS/PALS/TNCC:** These are just "Safety Belts." They are certifications that prove the nurse knows how to save an adult (ACLS), a child (PALS), or a trauma victim (TNCC) when their heart stops or they are dying.
*   **High-Acuity:** This just means "very, very sick."
*   **Precepting:** This is just a fancy word for "training or mentoring" newer nurses.

#### **The "Ideal" Candidate Profile**
*   **Experience:** They need at least 2 years in a hospital. Ideally, they’ve worked in an Emergency Room before.
*   **Education:** They need a BSN (4-year degree). If they have an ADN (2-year degree), they must be willing to go back to school.
*   **The "X-Factor":** We need someone who can "prioritize." In the ED, 10 things happen at once. This nurse needs to know which 1 thing is the most important.
