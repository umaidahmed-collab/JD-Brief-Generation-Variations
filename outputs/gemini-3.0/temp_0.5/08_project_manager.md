To create the most effective brief, I have organized this into two parts. 

**Part 1** is a draft of the "Recruiter Cheat Sheet" based on the JD you provided. It translates the jargon into plain English.

**Part 2** contains the critical questions I need you to answer. Once you provide these details, I will refine this into a "Final Master Brief" that will make your recruiter look like an industry expert.

### PART 1: DRAFT RECRUITER BRIEF (The "Plain English" Guide)

**The Role in a Nutshell:**
Think of the Senior Project Manager (SPM) as the "CEO of a specific construction project." They don’t swing hammers; they manage the money, the schedule, the people, and the problems. They are responsible for taking a $50M+ building from a drawing on a piece of paper to a finished structure, ensuring the company makes a profit and the client is happy.

#### 1. Jargon Buster: What these terms actually mean
*   **Pre-construction / Buyout:** This is the "shopping phase." Before building starts, the SPM hires all the specialized companies (plumbers, electricians, etc.) and negotiates their contracts to make sure they stay under budget.
*   **OAC Meetings:** Stands for Owner-Architect-Contractor. These are the "big boss" meetings. The SPM leads these to keep everyone on the same page.
*   **RFI (Request for Information):** A formal question. If a drawing is confusing, the SPM asks the Architect an RFI to get clarity.
*   **Submittals:** The "approval phase." Before a contractor installs a specific window or tile, the SPM must send the specs to the Architect to get a "thumbs up."
*   **Primavera P6 / MS Project:** These are just fancy calendars. They track thousands of tiny tasks to make sure the building is finished by the deadline.
*   **Procore:** This is the "Facebook/Dropbox of Construction." It’s the software where all photos, contracts, and emails for the project are stored.
*   **Change Orders:** When the owner wants to add something new (like an extra room), the SPM calculates the extra cost and gets it signed. This is how the company protects its profit.

#### 2. The "Ideal Candidate" Profile
*   **The "Big Project" Experience:** They shouldn't just have 10 years of experience; they need to have led projects worth **at least $30M**. Managing a $5M office renovation is very different from managing a $60M hospital.
*   **The Sector:** We prefer people who have built **Hospitals (Healthcare)** or **Schools (Education)**. These are "high-stakes" buildings with lots of complex wiring and regulations.
*   **The Tech-Savvy Builder:** They need to be comfortable using software like **Procore** and **Bluebeam**. If they still do everything on paper, they won’t fit here.

#### 3. Screening Questions for the Recruiter to Ask:
1.  *"What was the largest project (in dollar value) you managed from start to finish as the lead?"* (Looking for $30M+)
2.  *"Tell me about a time a project was falling behind schedule. How did you use your scheduling software (P6/MS Project) to fix it?"*
3.  *"How do you handle a subcontractor who is asking for more money than was originally agreed upon?"*

### PART 2: THE EXPERT'S CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
To make this brief "perfect," please answer the following:

**A. The "Why" & The Culture:**
1.  **Why is this role open?** (Is the company growing, or did someone leave? This helps the recruiter know if they are "replacing" or "building.")
2.  **What is the "vibe" of BuildRight?** Is it a high-pressure, "work hard/play hard" environment, or a more family-oriented, steady-paced company?
3.  **What is the #1 reason a candidate would leave a competitor to come to BuildRight?** (e.g., Better work-life balance? More autonomy? They get to work on the coolest buildings in Phoenix?)

**B. The Day-to-Day:**
4.  **The Travel:** It says 25-40%. Are these day trips within the Southwest, or will they be staying overnight in hotels 2 days a week?
5.  **The Team:** How many direct reports will this person have? (e.g., 2 Assistant PMs and a Project Coordinator?)

**C. The "Must-Haves" vs. "Flexibility":**
6.  **The Degree:** Is a Bachelor's degree a "hard" requirement? If someone has 20 years of amazing experience but no degree, would you see them?
7.  **Software:** If they are experts in a different software (like Sage or Autodesk) but haven't used Procore, is that a dealbreaker?
8.  **Project Types:** If a candidate has only done $100M High-Rise Residential (Apartments) but no Healthcare or Schools, are you interested?

**D. Compensation Nuances:**
9.  **The Bonus:** Is the 10-20% bonus "guaranteed" if they hit targets, or is it discretionary based on company profit?
10. **Vehicle:** Is the company vehicle a truck they can use for personal use, or a strict "work-only" allowance?

**Please provide the answers to these, and I will generate the final, comprehensive brief for your recruiter.**
