This is a high-stakes role, especially given its connection to the **Abu Dhabi Enterprise Resource Planning (ADERP)** system, which is the backbone of government operations. To a non-technical recruiter, "Applications Service Management" can sound like "fixing computers," but in reality, this person is the **Guardian of the Government’s Business Software.**

To create a brief that helps your recruiter spot the difference between a "tech manager" and a "strategic service leader," I need you to answer the following questions. 

I have categorized them so we can translate the technical requirements into "human" terms.

### 1. Context & The "Big Picture"
*   **The Organization:** Since the recruiter doesn't know the company, how would you describe the organization’s mission in one sentence? (e.g., "We are the central IT hub for all Abu Dhabi government financial operations.")
*   **The "Why" Now:** Is this a new role created because of a digital transformation, or is it a replacement? What is the biggest "fire" or challenge this person needs to put out in their first 6 months?
*   **ADERP Specifics:** ADERP is usually built on **Oracle EBS** or **Oracle Cloud**. Can you confirm which specific technology it is? This is the #1 thing a recruiter needs to filter for.

### 2. Translating the Technical Requirements
*   **Tier 1 ERPs:** The JD mentions SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. If you are using Oracle, would you actually consider someone who has *only* done SAP? Or is "Oracle experience" a non-negotiable "must-have"?
*   **Service Management (ITIL):** In plain English, ITIL is just a "rulebook" for how to handle tech problems. Does this person need to *build* the rulebook from scratch, or just *enforce* an existing one?
*   **Cloud vs. On-Premise:** Is the system hosted on your own servers (On-premise) or in the Cloud (Azure/AWS)? The way you manage these is very different.

### 3. Team & Stakeholder Dynamics
*   **The Team:** The JD mentions "ERP support analysts, service managers, specialists." How many people in total will report to this person? Are they all in-house, or are some outsourced to vendors (like IBM, Wipro, etc.)?
*   **The Stakeholders:** This role interacts with "Government Entities." Does this mean the candidate needs to be very formal and politically savvy? How "senior" are these stakeholders (e.g., Department Heads, Directors, or Ministers)?
*   **Vendor Management:** Will this person be the one "beating up" vendors to get better prices and faster fixes, or is it more about maintaining a friendly partnership?

### 4. The "Soft" Skills (The Cultural Fit)
*   **Communication Style:** Do you need a "Technical Expert" who can code if needed, or a "Business Leader" who spends 90% of their time in meetings and never touches the software itself?
*   **Pressure Handling:** When the ERP system goes down, the whole government might stop paying bills or salaries. What kind of temperament is required for that level of pressure?

### 5. The "Sell" & Logistics
*   **The Hook:** Why would a top-tier candidate leave a stable job at a global company like Microsoft or PwC to join you? (e.g., "You get to shape the digital future of Abu Dhabi.")
*   **Location/Work Style:** Is this 100% on-site in Abu Dhabi? Are there specific nationalities or language requirements (e.g., is Arabic mandatory or just a "nice to have")?
*   **Salary/Package:** You don't have to give me the number, but is the budget "Market Standard," "Aggressive/High," or "Fixed/Government Grade"?

**What to do next:**
Please provide the answers to as many of these as possible. Don't worry about formatting or using professional language—just give me the "raw" truth. 

**Once you reply, I will generate the final brief which will include:**
1.  **The "Elevator Pitch"** (How to sell the role).
2.  **The "Plain English" Role Summary.**
3.  **The "Green Flags"** (What a great candidate looks like on paper).
4.  **The "Red Flags"** (Who to reject immediately).
5.  **The "Cheat Sheet"** (Definitions of the technical terms for the recruiter).
