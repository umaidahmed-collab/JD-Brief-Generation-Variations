This is a great starting point. To transform this JD into a "Recruiter-Proof" brief that ensures they don't send you the wrong profiles, I need to dig into the nuances that aren't on the paper.

As an expert consultant, I need to understand the "vibe," the specific pain points you’re trying to solve, and how to explain the "finance-speak" to someone who doesn't know an income statement from a balance sheet.

Please answer the following questions:

### 1. The "Why" and the Team
*   **Why is this role open?** Is this a backfill (someone left), or a new headcount due to the 25% growth?
*   **Who does this person report to?** (e.g., a Director of FP&A, the VP of Finance, or the CFO?) What is that person’s leadership style?
*   **What does the rest of the team look like?** Will they have peers, or are they the "lone wolf" for the Cloud Services division?

### 2. Defining the "Technical" Requirements in Plain English
*   **The "SaaS" Factor:** You mentioned **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost) and **LTV** (Lifetime Value). Are these "must-haves"? If a candidate comes from a traditional manufacturing background but is a math genius, would you consider them, or is SaaS experience a deal-breaker?
*   **Excel Level:** When you say "Advanced Excel," do you mean they just need to use formulas, or are you looking for someone who can build a 3-statement model from scratch without help?
*   **The Tools:** If they haven't used **Adaptive** or **Anaplan**, but have used other similar software, is that okay? Which tool is the "must-have"?

### 3. The "Business Partner" Element
*   This role partners with the **Cloud Services** division. In your company, are those leaders "finance-friendly," or are they "sales-heavy" people who need finance explained to them simply? 
*   Does this person need to be a "challenger" (someone who says "no" to budgets) or a "support" person (someone who just cleans up the data)?

### 4. The "Public Company" Nuance
*   You mentioned **Quarterly Earnings** and **SEC/GAAP** context. Does this person need to have worked at a public company before, or is a high-performer from a large private company acceptable?
*   How much "crunch time" is involved during the quarterly close or earnings season? (Recruiters need to manage expectations on work-life balance).

### 5. The "Selling" Points (The Hook)
*   Austin is a competitive market. Besides the salary, **what is the "coolest" project** this person will work on in the first 6 months? (e.g., an acquisition, a new product launch, a system implementation?)
*   What is the **career path**? In 2 years, what does this person become?

### 6. Screening "Red Flags"
*   What is one thing that, if you saw it on a resume, would make you say **"No" immediately**? (e.g., too many job jumps, no experience with $100M+ budgets, etc.)

**Once you provide these details, I will synthesize them into a comprehensive brief that explains every acronym (like FP&A, CAC, LTV, GAAP) in plain English so your recruiter can hunt with precision.**
