This is a great starting point. To transform this Job Description into a "Recruiter’s Playbook" that a non-technical recruiter can use to find your "Purple Squirrel" (the perfect candidate), I need to dig deeper into the nuances that aren't in the JD.

Please answer the following questions. Your answers will allow me to explain the *context* to the recruiter so they don't just "keyword match," but actually understand the business need.

### 1. The "Why" and the Mission
*   **The Catalyst:** Why is this role open now? Is it a replacement for someone who left, or a brand-new role created because the company is scaling?
*   **The Big Goal:** If this person is successful, what is the #1 thing they will have achieved one year from now? (e.g., "Launched us into Whole Foods nationwide" or "Doubled our online subscription revenue").

### 2. The Ideal Candidate Profile (Beyond the JD)
*   **The "DNA" of the Brand:** GreenLeaf is "organic and sustainable." Do you need someone who is a "true believer" in sustainability, or are you looking for a "growth hacker" who just knows how to sell products regardless of the mission?
*   **The "Target" Companies:** If you could "steal" a candidate from 3 specific companies, who would they be? (e.g., "Someone from Annie’s Homegrown, Honest Co, or a high-growth startup like Liquid Death").
*   **The Performance vs. Brand Balance:** This role covers both "Brand" (storytelling, look/feel) and "Performance" (numbers, ROI, ads). Which one is the priority? Do you want a Creative/Storyteller or a Data/Math person?

### 3. Deep Dive into Technicals (for the non-technical recruiter)
*   **The "Tech Stack":** The JD mentions Google Analytics, Tableau, and HubSpot. Which of these is a "must-have" on Day 1, and which can be learned?
*   **The CPG Factor:** How important is "Retail/Trade Marketing" (getting products on physical shelves) versus "DTC" (selling directly to consumers via your website)?
*   **The Budget:** They will manage $2M. Have they managed this *annually* or *per campaign*? Does this include their team's salaries, or is it $2M in pure "working media" (money spent on ads)?

### 4. Management & Culture
*   **The Team:** You mentioned a team of 4. What is the biggest challenge this team is currently facing that the new manager needs to fix?
*   **Reporting Line:** Who does this person report to? (e.g., a Founder, a CMO, or a VP of Sales?) What is that person’s leadership style?
*   **The "Denver" Factor:** Is the "3 days in office" non-negotiable? Can the recruiter look at candidates willing to relocate, or do they need to be local?

### 5. The "Sizzle" (Selling the Role)
*   **The Growth Story:** You went from $0 to $50M in 5 years. What’s the next milestone? ($100M? An IPO? Acquisition?)
*   **The "Pain Point":** What is the hardest part of this job that the recruiter should warn candidates about? (e.g., "It’s very fast-paced," or "We have limited resources despite the $2M budget").

### 6. The "Knock-Out" Questions
*   What are 2 or 3 questions the recruiter can ask in a 15-minute phone screen to immediately tell if the candidate is a "No"?

**Once you provide these details, I will draft the comprehensive brief that explains all these terms (like CAC, LTV, and Programmatic) in plain English for your recruiter.**
