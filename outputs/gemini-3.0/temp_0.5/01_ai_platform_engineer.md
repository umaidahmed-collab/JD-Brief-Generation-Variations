This is a classic "Rescue & Scale" mission. To find the right person, your recruiter needs to understand that this isn’t just a coding job; it’s a **Technical Ownership** job. We are looking for a "fixer" who can handle the pressure of a messy codebase and turn it into a professional product.

To help me write a brief that makes sense to a non-technical recruiter, please answer the following questions. Don't worry about being formal—just give me the raw details.

### 1. The Context (The "Why")
*   **The "Elevator Pitch":** In two sentences, what does D50 AI actually do for its customers? (e.g., "It’s an automated sales agent that calls leads and books appointments.")
*   **The Current State:** You mentioned the code is "imperfect." On a scale of 1–10 (1 being "total rewrite needed" and 10 being "just needs a few tweaks"), where is it?
*   **The Urgency:** Is the platform currently live with paying customers, or are we trying to get it ready for a specific launch date?

### 2. The Tech Stack (The "What")
*   **The Language:** The JD says "Node.js / Python." Which one is the *majority* of the existing codebase written in? (We need to tell the recruiter which one is a "Must Have" vs. a "Nice to Have").
*   **The Frontend:** It says "React-based." Is it a standard React app, or something like Next.js?
*   **The "Hardest" Part:** Which part of the system is the most complex right now? Is it the AI voice latency, the Twilio call routing, or the MongoDB data structure?

### 3. The Ideal Candidate Profile (The "Who")
*   **The "DNA":** This role requires someone who is comfortable with "chaos." Should the recruiter look for someone from a big corporate background (structured) or someone who has been a "Founding Engineer" at a tiny startup before?
*   **The Telephony Piece:** How critical is the Twilio/Telnyx experience? Is it okay if they’ve never done it but are fast learners, or is it a dealbreaker?
*   **The AI Piece:** Do they need to know how to build AI models (Data Science), or just how to connect to APIs like OpenAI and ElevenLabs (Software Engineering)?

### 4. Logistics & Selling Points (The "How")
*   **The Salary:** What is the budget or range for this role? (Recruiters need this to filter candidates immediately).
*   **The Team:** Will this person be a "Team of One" reporting to the founder, or are there other developers/freelancers they will manage?
*   **The "Hook":** Why would a top-tier engineer want *this* job instead of a high-paying job at a stable tech giant? (e.g., "Total autonomy," "Equity/Profit sharing," "Building the future of AI voice").

### 5. The "Red Flags"
*   What kind of person will **fail** in this role? (e.g., "Someone who asks for a manual on their first day," or "Someone who only wants to write new code and hates debugging.")

**Once you provide these details, I will draft a brief that explains terms like "AI Orchestration," "Latency," and "Asynchronous Systems" in a way that your recruiter can explain to a candidate with total confidence.**
