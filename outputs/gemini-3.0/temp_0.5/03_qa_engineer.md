To create a truly effective brief for a non-technical recruiter, I need to go beyond the bullet points in the JD. I need to understand the **"soul"** of the role—what a typical day looks like, which skills are actually non-negotiable, and how to sell this job to a candidate who has five other offers.

Please answer the following questions. Once you provide these details, I will synthesize everything into a "Plain English" recruiter brief.

### 1. The "Big Picture" (Context)
*   **What does your company actually do?** (Imagine explaining it to a 10-year-old).
*   **Why is this role open?** (Is the team expanding, or are you replacing someone? If replacing, what did the previous person lack?)
*   **What is the "Product"?** (Is it a mobile app, a website for banks, an internal data tool? This changes the type of QA needed.)

### 2. Manual vs. Automation (The Balance)
*   **What is the split?** In a 40-hour week, how many hours are spent manually clicking and checking things (Manual) vs. writing code to do the testing for them (Automation)? (e.g., 50/50, 20/80?)
*   **The "Build" vs. "Maintain" question:** Are they building an automation framework from scratch, or are they just adding tests to a system that already exists?

### 3. Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves (The Filter)
*   **The Coding Language:** The JD lists Python, Java, and JavaScript. Which one do you *actually* use? Does the candidate need to be a pro, or just able to read it?
*   **The Tools:** You mentioned Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright. Usually, a company uses one. Which one is your primary tool?
*   **The "Dealbreaker":** If a candidate is amazing at manual testing but has never touched "CI/CD" (the automated delivery pipeline), would you still interview them?

### 4. The "Day in the Life"
*   **Who do they talk to most?** Will they be embedded with developers, or are they a "final gatekeeper" who checks the work at the very end?
*   **What is the biggest challenge they will face in the first 90 days?** (e.g., messy documentation, fast deadlines, old code?)

### 5. Soft Skills & Culture
*   **Personality type:** Do you want a "Sherlock Holmes" (someone who loves hunting for tiny errors) or a "Diplomat" (someone who can tell a developer their code is broken without upsetting them)?
*   **Working Style:** Is your Agile process strict (lots of meetings/structure) or "Agile-ish" (fast-paced and a bit chaotic)?

### 6. Logistics & "The Hook"
*   **Salary Range:** (Even a rough bracket helps the recruiter filter).
*   **Location:** Is this 100% Remote, Hybrid, or On-site?
*   **The "Sell":** Why would a top-tier QA Engineer leave their current job to join you? (e.g., "We use the latest tech," "We have a 4-day work week," "Our product saves lives.")

**Once you provide these answers, I will draft the brief that explains exactly what a "Regression Test" or a "CI/CD Pipeline" is in a way your recruiter can explain to candidates confidently.**
