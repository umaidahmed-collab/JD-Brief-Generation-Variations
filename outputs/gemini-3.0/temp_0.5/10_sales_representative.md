This is a high-stakes hire. An Enterprise Sales Representative (ESR) at this compensation level ($280k - $350k) is a "heavy hitter" role. To ensure your recruiter doesn't just send you generic resumes, I need to help them understand the **nuance** of what makes a "CloudSecure" winner versus just a "good salesperson."

To build this comprehensive brief, please answer the following questions. I have grouped them by category to make it easier for you.

### 1. The "Elevator Pitch" (The Hook)
*   **The "Explain it like I'm 5" version:** If you had to explain what CloudSecure does to a non-technical person in two sentences, what would you say? (e.g., "We are the digital security guards for a company's data when they move it from their own office to the internet.")
*   **The "Why Us?":** Why would a Fortune 1000 CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) buy from you instead of a massive competitor like Palo Alto Networks or CrowdStrike? What is your "unfair advantage"?

### 2. The Ideal Candidate "DNA"
*   **The "Hunter" Definition:** You mentioned a "Hunter mentality." Does this mean they are doing 100% of their own cold-prospecting, or do they have a BDR (Business Development Rep) to book meetings for them?
*   **The "Sweet Spot" Company:** Which companies should the recruiter "steal" talent from? (e.g., "Look for people from Okta, Zscaler, or Wiz.")
*   **The "Hidden" Requirement:** Is there a specific type of background that usually fails in this role? (e.g., "People who come from big companies like Oracle often fail here because they are used to a big brand name doing the work for them.")

### 3. The Sales Motion (The "How")
*   **The "Stakeholder" Map:** In a typical deal, who is the "Champion" (the person who loves the tool) and who is the "Economic Buyer" (the person who signs the check)?
*   **The Technical Bar:** How technical does this salesperson *actually* need to be? Do they need to be able to run a demo themselves, or do they just need to know enough to hand it off to a Sales Engineer?
*   **MEDDIC:** You mentioned MEDDIC. Is this a "nice to have" or a "must-have"? If they use a different methodology (like Challenger or Sandler), is that okay?

### 4. Territory & Logistics
*   **The "Western US" Focus:** Is there a specific city where you’d prefer they be based for travel reasons (e.g., "Ideally Seattle or LA"), or is anywhere in the West truly okay?
*   **The "Fortune 1000" List:** Do you have a specific list of "Dream Accounts" you want this person to go after on Day 1?

### 5. Compensation & Culture
*   **The "Quota" Reality:** What percentage of the current sales team is actually hitting that $1.5M - $2M quota? (Recruiters need this to "sell" the role to top talent).
*   **The "Growth" Story:** You're growing 100% YoY. What does that mean for this person’s career in 2 years? (e.g., "They could become a Regional VP.")

### 6. Jargon Check (For the Recruiter)
*   **Definitions:** I will define these in the final brief, but are there any *other* specific technical terms your team uses daily that a recruiter might hear on a call and get confused by? (e.g., "Zero Trust," "CNAPP," "Post-Quantum.")

**Once you provide these details, I will draft a "Recruiter Playbook" that explains:**
1.  **The Mission:** In plain English.
2.  **The "Target Persona":** Exactly who to look for.
3.  **The "Screening Questions":** Specific questions the recruiter can ask to see if the candidate is faking it.
4.  **The "Glossary":** A cheat sheet of technical terms translated into "human."
5.  **The "Red Flags":** Who to reject immediately.

**Please provide as much detail as you can!**
