To create a truly "bulletproof" brief for a non-technical recruiter, I first need to fill in some gaps that aren't in the standard JD. While I have drafted a comprehensive brief below based on the information provided, **please review the "Information I Still Need" section at the bottom.** Answering those questions will allow us to move from a "good" brief to an "exceptional" one.

Here is the comprehensive recruiter brief designed for a non-technical external partner.

# Recruiter Search Brief: HR Business Partner (Engineering & Product)

## 1. The "Elevator Pitch" (How to sell this role)
GlobalTech Solutions is a stable, 3,500-person "Best Place to Work" that is currently in a high-growth "scale-up" phase. This isn't a boring administrative HR role. This person will be the "Right Hand" to the leaders who build our products. They will help shape the culture of an 800-person technical organization. If the candidate wants to move away from "paperwork HR" and into "business strategy HR," this is the role.

## 2. What is an HR Business Partner (HRBP)? 
*Explain this to the candidate if they ask:* 
Think of an HRBP as a **Consultant** who lives inside the company. They don't just process payroll or hire people. They sit with the VPs of Engineering and Product to help them solve "people puzzles." 
*   *Example:* If the VP of Engineering says, "My team is burnt out and quitting," the HRBP doesn't just say "sorry." They look at the data, suggest a new bonus structure, coach the managers on how to talk to their teams, and redesign the team structure to fix the problem.

## 3. Who is the "Client"? (Understanding Engineering & Product)
The candidate will support **800 people** in the Engineering and Product departments. 
*   **Engineering:** The people who write the code and build the software. They are usually very logical, data-driven, and sometimes introverted. They value efficiency and hate "fluff."
*   **Product:** The people who decide *what* to build. They are the bridge between the customers and the engineers. They are usually highly creative and fast-paced.
*   **The Vibe:** This group is the "engine room" of the company. The HRBP needs to be comfortable talking to very smart, technical people who expect clear answers backed by facts and data.

## 4. Key Responsibilities (In Plain English)
*   **Strategic Coaching:** Being a "brave truth-teller" to senior VPs. Helping them become better leaders.
*   **Organizational Design:** Helping the VPs decide how to group teams. (e.g., "Should we have 10 small teams or 2 big ones?")
*   **Employee Relations:** Handling the "tough stuff"—performance issues, personality clashes, or legal complaints—with a cool head.
*   **Talent Reviews & Calibration:** Leading meetings where managers compare how their employees are performing to ensure everyone is being graded fairly.
*   **Compensation:** Working with the finance team to make sure we are paying our engineers enough so they don't get stolen by Google or Meta.

## 5. The Ideal Candidate Profile
**The "Must-Haves":**
*   **7+ Years in HR:** They shouldn't be a beginner. They need "battle scars."
*   **The "Tech" Factor:** They must have worked in a software/tech company before. Why? Because HR in a software company is very different from HR in a factory or a hospital.
*   **Workday Experience:** Workday is the software we use to track employee data. It’s complex, so we need someone who already knows how to use it.
*   **Data Literacy:** They shouldn't be afraid of Excel. They need to be able to look at a spreadsheet of turnover rates and tell a story about why people are leaving.

**The "Soft Skills" (What to look for in the interview):**
*   **High EQ (Emotional Intelligence):** Can they read a room? Can they deliver bad news without making people angry?
*   **Influence:** Can they convince a stubborn VP to change their mind without having "boss" authority over them?

## 6. Jargon Buster (Terms the recruiter should know)
*   **RSU (Restricted Stock Units):** A promise to give the employee company stock in the future. It’s a major part of the pay package.
*   **Calibration:** A meeting where managers make sure they are all using the same "bar" to judge performance.
*   **Succession Planning:** Identifying who would take over if a leader quit tomorrow.
*   **Retention Strategies:** Creative ways to keep employees from quitting.
*   **Hybrid/Remote:** We are flexible, but if they are in the SF Bay Area, we want them in the office 2 days a week to build relationships.

## 7. Screening Questions for the Recruiter to Ask
1.  "Tell me about a time you had to give tough feedback to a senior leader (like a VP). How did they react?"
2.  "What is the most complex 'people' problem you’ve solved for an Engineering team?"
3.  "How do you use data to convince a manager that a change is necessary?"
4.  "What is your experience with Workday? (On a scale of 1-10, how much of a power user are you?)"

# 🚩 Information I Still Need from You (The Hiring Manager)
To make this brief 100% accurate, please answer these 5 questions:

1.  **The "Why":** Why is this role open? (Is it a replacement for someone who left, or a brand new role because the company is growing?)
2.  **The "Pain Point":** What is the #1 problem the VPs of Engineering and Product are facing right now that this HRBP needs to fix immediately? (e.g., high turnover, bad management, or messy restructuring?)
3.  **The "Culture":** Is the Engineering team's culture "work hard/play hard," "academic and quiet," or "fast and chaotic"?
4.  **The "Must-Have" Location:** Is "Remote" truly okay for a superstar, or is there a strong preference for someone in the SF Bay Area?
5.  **The "Non-Negotiable":** If a candidate is perfect in every way but has never used **Workday**, is that a dealbreaker? (Recruiters need to know if "Preferred" actually means "Required").
