This is a great starting point. To transform this Job Description into a "Recruiter’s Cheat Sheet" that a non-technical person can use to find you a "Purple Squirrel" (the perfect candidate), I need to dig deeper into the context.

I have categorized my questions into four key areas. Please answer these as best as you can.

### 1. The "Selling Points" (Why would a top performer leave their current job?)
*   **The "Why":** Why is this position open? (Growth, a specific new $100M project, or replacing someone?)
*   **The Culture:** Is BuildRight a "work hard, play hard" environment, a family-oriented culture, or a high-pressure corporate machine?
*   **The Career Path:** What is the next step for this person? (e.g., Project Executive, VP of Operations?)
*   **The Projects:** Are there any specific, high-profile projects they will start on immediately? (Recruiters love "selling" a specific landmark project).

### 2. Technical "Plain English" Clarifications
*   **The Software:** If they don't know **Procore** or **Primavera P6**, is that a dealbreaker, or can they be trained if they are "tech-savvy"?
*   **The "Buyout" Process:** In your company, how much of the "buyout" (hiring the subcontractors) does the SPM do vs. a dedicated Estimating team?
*   **Healthcare Experience:** You mentioned Healthcare is a specialty. Does the candidate *need* to understand **OSHPD/HCAI** or **ICRA** (infection control) protocols? (These are huge technical hurdles in healthcare construction).
*   **Project Size:** You mentioned $30M–$100M. If a candidate has only done $15M projects but has done 20 of them, is that a "No"?

### 3. The "Soft Skills" (The stuff not on the JD)
*   **The "Owner" Relationship:** Will this person be dealing with sophisticated developers or institutional clients (like Universities)? The "vibe" required for each is very different.
*   **Leadership Style:** Do you need a "tough-as-nails" manager who keeps subcontractors in line, or a "collaborative diplomat" who builds long-term partnerships?
*   **The "Red Flags":** What is one thing that, if you saw it on a resume or heard it in an interview, would make you say "No" immediately?

### 4. Logistics & Process
*   **Travel:** It says 25-40% travel. Is this "home for dinner" travel within Arizona, or "gone for 3 days a week" travel across the Southwest?
*   **The Interview Process:** What does the "gauntlet" look like? (e.g., 1. Recruiter screen, 2. Hiring Manager Zoom, 3. In-person panel).
*   **Relocation:** Will you pay for someone to move to Phoenix, or do they *have* to be local?

**What happens next?**
Once you provide these details, I will draft a **"Recruiter’s Field Guide"** for you. It will include:
1.  **The "Elevator Pitch":** How to sell the job in 30 seconds.
2.  **The "Keyword Translator":** Explaining terms like *RFI, Submittals, and Change Orders* so the recruiter knows what to ask.
3.  **The "Screening Script":** 5-7 specific questions the recruiter can ask to see if the candidate is faking it.
4.  **The "Ideal Profile" Summary:** A plain-English description of the person they are looking for.

**Please share the answers to the questions above!**
