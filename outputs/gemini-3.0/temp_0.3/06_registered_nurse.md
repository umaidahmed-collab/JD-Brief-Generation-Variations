This is a great starting point. As an expert recruitment consultant, my goal is to bridge the gap between your clinical needs and the recruiter’s lack of technical knowledge. 

To create a brief that ensures the recruiter doesn't just find "a nurse," but finds **"the right nurse,"** I need to dig deeper into the nuances of your department.

Please answer the following questions. Don't worry about using professional language—just give me the "real world" details.

### 1. The "Why" and the Culture
*   **Why is this role open?** Is the department expanding, or are you replacing someone? (This helps the recruiter know if they are looking for a "stabilizer" or a "builder").
*   **How would you describe the "vibe" of the ED team?** Is it a "work hard, play hard" group? Is it a high-intensity environment where people are blunt, or is it a very nurturing, teaching-focused environment?
*   **What is the "Selling Point"?** If a candidate is looking at three different Level I Trauma Centers, why should they pick Metropolitan General? (e.g., "We have the best equipment," "Our doctors actually listen to the nurses," "We have the fastest promotion track.")

### 2. The "Ideal Candidate" (Beyond the JD)
*   **The "Must-Haves" vs. "Nice-to-Haves":** If I find a brilliant nurse with 5 years of ICU experience but 0 years of ED experience, would you talk to them? 
*   **Personality Profile:** In your experience, what kind of personality *fails* in your ED? (e.g., people who need a strict routine, people who are sensitive to criticism, etc.)
*   **The "BSN" Requirement:** You mentioned ADN is considered with a commitment to get a BSN. How strict is that 2-year timeline?

### 3. The Day-to-Day Reality
*   **Patient Ratios:** This is the #1 question nurses ask. What is the typical nurse-to-patient ratio in your ED? Does it change for the Trauma bay vs. the Triage area?
*   **The "Epic" Factor:** How much training will you provide on the EMR (Epic), or do they need to be "plug and play" on day one?
*   **Support Staff:** Will this nurse have dedicated Techs, LPNs, or Scribes helping them, or are they doing everything (vitals, cleaning, charting) themselves?

### 4. Logistics & Compensation
*   **The Sign-on Bonus:** How is the $15,000 paid out? (e.g., half at 90 days, half at one year?) Recruiters need this to "hook" candidates.
*   **Shift Flexibility:** You mentioned 12-hour shifts. Is there any flexibility for "mid-shifts" (e.g., 11am–11pm) which are common in EDs?
*   **The Interview Process:** What does the process look like? (e.g., 1. Phone screen with HR, 2. Peer interview with the team, 3. Shadow shift). Knowing this helps the recruiter "sell" the next steps.

### 5. Jargon Check
I will define these in the final brief, but are there any **other** specific terms, certifications, or "nursing lingo" your team uses daily that a recruiter might hear and get confused by? (e.g., "boarding," "left without being seen," "divert status").

**Once you provide these details, I will draft a comprehensive, "jargon-free" brief that will make your external recruiter look like an industry expert.**
