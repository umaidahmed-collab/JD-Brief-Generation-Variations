This is a fascinating role. You aren't just looking for a "Developer"; you are looking for a **"Technical Rescuer"** or a **"Product Stabilizer."** 

Because your recruiter is non-technical and external, they will likely fall into the trap of just looking for keywords (Node.js, React, OpenAI). To prevent them from sending you "ticket-takers" or "feature-builders," we need to give them a brief that explains the **mission** and the **mindset** required.

To build this comprehensive brief, I need you to answer the following questions. Your answers will allow me to translate the "tech-speak" into a "scouting guide" for your recruiter.

### 1. The Business Context (The "Why")
*   **The Elevator Pitch:** In two sentences, what does D50 AI actually do for its customers? (e.g., "It’s an automated sales agent that calls leads and books appointments using AI voices.")
*   **The "State of Emergency":** You mentioned the codebase is "imperfect" and "chaotic." On a scale of 1–10 (1 being "minor bugs" and 10 being "the house is on fire"), how urgent is the stabilization? 
*   **The Goal:** Six months from now, what does "success" look like for this person?

### 2. The Ideal Candidate Profile (The "Who")
*   **The "Fixer" Mentality:** This role requires someone who enjoys "untangling systems." What is the one personality trait that is a dealbreaker? (e.g., "If they need a project manager to tell them what to do every morning, they will fail.")
*   **Seniority Level:** Are you looking for a "Lead/Architect" who can still code 80% of the time, or a "Senior Individual Contributor" who just wants to be left alone to build?
*   **The "Founder-Fit":** You mentioned working directly with a founder who needs execution. Does the candidate need to be comfortable with "tough love" or high-pressure pivots?

### 3. Technical Priorities (The "What")
*   **The "Must-Haves":** If a candidate is a genius at AI but has never touched **Telephony (Twilio/Telnyx)**, is that a dealbreaker? 
*   **The Language:** The JD says "Node.js / Python (at least one deeply)." Which one is the *current* platform built in? (The recruiter needs to know which one to prioritize).
*   **The AI Piece:** Is it more important that they understand *how to build* AI models, or *how to connect* different AI APIs (like OpenAI and ElevenLabs) so they don't break?

### 4. The "Red Flags" for the Recruiter
*   What are 3 things on a LinkedIn profile that should make the recruiter say **"No"** immediately? (e.g., "Only worked at huge companies like Google/Meta," "Only does 'Greenfield'/new projects," "No experience with AWS.")

### 5. Logistics & Selling Points (The "Hook")
*   **The Budget:** What is the salary range or compensation structure? (External recruiters need this to filter candidates immediately).
*   **Timezone:** It’s fully remote, but do they need to overlap with a specific timezone (e.g., EST or GMT) for meetings with the founder?
*   **The "Why Us?":** Why would a talented engineer leave a stable job to come "fix chaos" at Division50? (e.g., Equity, massive autonomy, path to CTO, etc.)

### 6. The Interview Process
*   What will the stages look like? (e.g., 1. Recruiter screen, 2. Technical deep dive with [Who?], 3. Final chat with Founder).
