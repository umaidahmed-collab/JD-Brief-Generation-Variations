To create a truly "bulletproof" brief for a non-technical recruiter, I have structured this into two parts.

**Part 1** is a comprehensive draft brief based on the information you provided, translated into "plain English." 

**Part 2** is a list of "Deep-Dive Questions" I need you to answer. Once you answer these, we can refine Part 1 into a final, high-precision document that ensures the recruiter doesn't waste your time with the wrong candidates.

### PART 1: THE RECRUITER BRIEF (DRAFT)

**Role:** Senior Marketing Manager
**Company:** GreenLeaf Organics
**Location:** Denver, CO (Hybrid: 3 days in office / 2 days remote)
**Salary:** $120,000 – $150,000 + 20% Bonus + Equity

#### 1. The "Elevator Pitch" (How to sell this role)
GreenLeaf Organics is a massive success story. They’ve grown from $0 to $50M in revenue in just five years. They sell organic, sustainable food. This isn't just a "job"; it’s a chance to lead the marketing for a brand that people actually feel good about buying. The person in this role will be the "engine" behind the next phase of growth.

#### 2. What does this person actually do?
In simple terms, this person is the **Conductor of the Orchestra.** They don't just play one instrument (like social media); they make sure the whole "music" (the brand) sounds great across the internet, in grocery stores, and in emails. 
*   **They lead people:** They manage a team of 4.
*   **They spend money wisely:** They have a $2M budget to make sure for every $1 spent, the company makes significantly more back.
*   **They launch products:** They will help bring 10+ new food products to market every year.

#### 3. Jargon Buster (Terms you need to know)
When talking to candidates, they will use these terms. Here is what they mean:
*   **CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods):** Anything you buy at a grocery store that gets used up and replaced (like snacks, milk, or soap). **This is a must-have background.**
*   **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** How much it costs in marketing dollars to get one new customer to buy a product. (Lower is better).
*   **LTV (Lifetime Value):** How much money a customer will spend with the company over their whole life. (Higher is better).
*   **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend):** For every $1 we spent on ads, how many dollars did we make back?
*   **SEM (Search Engine Marketing):** The paid ads you see at the top of Google.
*   **Programmatic Advertising:** Using software to automatically buy digital ad space (rather than calling a website owner directly).

#### 4. The "Must-Haves" (The Filter)
If they don't have these, do not send them to us:
*   **CPG Experience:** They must have worked for a company that sells physical products (ideally food/drink).
*   **Management Experience:** They must have managed at least 2-3 people directly before.
*   **Budget Management:** They must have handled a budget of at least $1M. If they’ve only ever spent $50k, they aren't ready for this.
*   **Analytical Mindset:** They need to be "numbers people." Ask them: *"How do you prove your marketing is working?"* If they don't mention data or ROI, they aren't a fit.

#### 5. The "Ideal" Candidate (The "Unicorn")
*   Someone who has worked in "Natural/Organic" foods (e.g., worked at Whole Foods Market, or a brand sold there).
*   Someone who understands "Sustainability"—they know how to market to people who care about the planet.
*   Someone who is "scrappy"—even though we are a $50M company, we still move fast like a startup.

### PART 2: QUESTIONS FOR YOU (The Hiring Manager)

To make this brief perfect, please answer the following:

1.  **The "Why" Now:** Is this a brand-new role created because of growth, or are we replacing someone who left? (This helps the recruiter explain the "story" of the role).
2.  **The Team:** You mentioned a team of 4. What are their specific roles? (e.g., 1 Graphic Designer, 1 Social Media Manager, etc.)
3.  **The "Big Challenge":** What is the #1 problem this person needs to solve in their first 6 months? (e.g., "Our cost to get a customer is too high" or "Our brand looks messy and inconsistent").
4.  **The Tech Stack:** Are there specific tools they *must* know? (e.g., Shopify, Klaviyo, Meta Ads Manager?)
5.  **The Culture:** Is your office environment "corporate and professional" or "casual and high-energy"?
6.  **The "Hard No's":** Are there any industries you *don't* want to see? (e.g., "No one from Software/SaaS" or "No one from pure Agency backgrounds").
7.  **The Retail Factor:** How much of your sales are online (DTC) vs. in physical grocery stores? (This changes the type of marketer we need).
8.  **The Interview Process:** What are the steps? (e.g., 1. Recruiter screen, 2. Hiring Manager call, 3. Case study/Presentation, 4. Final onsite).

**Please provide the answers to these, and I will finalize the brief for your recruiter!**
