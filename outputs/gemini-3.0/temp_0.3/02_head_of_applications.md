This is a high-stakes role, especially given its connection to the **Abu Dhabi Enterprise Resource Planning (ADERP)** system, which suggests a significant impact on government operations.

To help your non-technical recruiter find the right person, I need to "translate" the technical requirements into business outcomes and human behaviors. Before I write the final brief, please answer the following questions. 

Your answers will allow me to explain to the recruiter exactly *what* to look for beyond just keywords on a resume.

### 1. The "Big Picture" & Context
*   **What is ADERP exactly?** Is it built on a specific platform (like Oracle or SAP) or is it a custom-built government system? (This helps the recruiter know if they should target "Oracle experts" or "General ERP experts").
*   **The "Why" now:** Is this a new role, or are you replacing someone? If it’s a replacement, what was missing in the previous person? If it’s new, what specific problem is the business trying to solve right now (e.g., too many system crashes, slow response times, poor vendor performance)?
*   **The Stakeholders:** The JD mentions "Government entities." Will this person be presenting to high-ranking officials? How "polished" and politically savvy do they need to be?

### 2. Defining the "Service Management" Piece
*   **Technical vs. Process:** Does this person need to know how to *code/configure* the ERP, or do they just need to know how to *manage the people and processes* who do the technical work?
*   **The "Firefighter" Aspect:** How often do "Major Incidents" (system crashes) happen? Is this a "steady state" management role, or a "transformation/cleanup" role?

### 3. Team & Vendor Structure
*   **Team Size:** How many direct reports? Are they located in Abu Dhabi, or are they offshore?
*   **Vendor Heavy?** The JD mentions "Accountability for vendor teams." Is the work mostly done by external consultants (like IBM, Accenture, etc.) or by internal employees? This changes the profile from a "People Manager" to a "Contract/Vendor Manager."

### 4. The "Must-Haves" (The Dealbreakers)
*   **The "Tier 1" Requirement:** You mentioned SAP, Oracle, or Microsoft. Is there one specific one that is a "must," or is the logic of managing *any* large system enough?
*   **Location/Language:** Does the candidate need to be based in Abu Dhabi already? Is Arabic a requirement, or is English sufficient?
*   **Industry Background:** Do they *need* government experience, or would you welcome someone from a high-pressure corporate environment (like Banking or Telecom)?

### 5. The "Hook" (Selling the Role)
*   **Why would a top-tier candidate want this job?** Is it the scale of the project? The stability of a government-linked role? A specific digital transformation budget?
*   **Salary & Benefits:** (You don't have to give me the exact number, but tell me if it is "Market Leading," "Competitive," or "Standard.")

### 6. The "Non-Technical" Translation
*   If you had to describe the "perfect" candidate in three non-technical words (e.g., "Diplomatic," "Resilient," "Process-driven"), what would they be?

**Once you provide these details, I will draft a brief that explains:**
1.  **The Role in Plain English** (e.g., "The Air Traffic Controller for the Government’s most important software").
2.  **What to look for on a CV** (beyond the keywords).
3.  **"Knock-out" questions** the recruiter can ask in a 5-minute phone screen to save you time.
4.  **Red flags** to avoid.
