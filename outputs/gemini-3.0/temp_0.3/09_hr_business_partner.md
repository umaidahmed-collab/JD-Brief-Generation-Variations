This is a great starting point. To transform this Job Description (JD) into a "Recruiter’s Cheat Sheet" that a non-technical person can use to find you a unicorn, I need to dig deeper into the **context, the "vibe," and the unspoken requirements.**

An external recruiter needs to know not just what the person *does*, but what makes someone *fail* or *succeed* in your specific culture.

Please answer the following questions. Don't worry about being formal—bullet points are fine.

### 1. The "Why" and the Environment
*   **The Transformation:** The JD mentions "significant growth and transformation." What does this actually mean? (e.g., Are you moving from startup to corporate? Are you fixing a "broken" culture? Are you preparing for an IPO?)
*   **The Engineering/Product Vibe:** Engineers and Product Managers often have a specific way of working (data-driven, direct, sometimes skeptical of HR). What is the "personality" of these 800 people?
*   **The "Pain Point":** Why is this role open? Is it a backfill (someone left) or a new headcount? If someone left, what was missing in their performance that you want to see in the new person?

### 2. The Stakeholders (The VPs)
*   **The Personalities:** You’ll be supporting the VP of Engineering and VP of Product. What are they like? (e.g., "The VP of Eng is very data-obsessed and hates fluff," or "The VP of Product is a visionary who needs help with the practical side of people management.")
*   **The Relationship:** Will this HRBP have a "seat at the table," or are they expected to just execute orders?

### 3. Defining "Complex Employee Relations"
*   In plain English, what kind of "fires" will this person be putting out? (e.g., "We have a lot of high-performers who are difficult to manage," or "We are dealing with a lot of remote-work conflict," or "We need someone who can handle sensitive terminations without getting the company sued.")

### 4. The "Must-Haves" vs. "Nice-to-Haves"
*   **The Tech Experience:** Is it a deal-breaker if they haven't supported an Engineering team before? (Why this matters: Engineers often respect HR more if the HRBP understands things like "Sprints," "Technical Debt," or "Product Roadmaps.")
*   **Workday:** Is "Workday preferred" actually a "must"? If they’ve used a different system (like Greenhouse or Oracle), is that okay?
*   **Location:** You mentioned Hybrid (SF) or Remote. If they are remote, do they need to be in a specific timezone to support the global teams?

### 5. The "Selling Points" (The Hook)
*   Why would a top-tier HRBP leave a company like Google or Meta to come to GlobalTech Solutions? What is the "hidden gem" of this job?
*   What does "Unlimited PTO" actually look like in practice at your company? (Do people actually take it?)

### 6. Success Metrics
*   Six months from now, how will you know you hired the right person? What is the #1 thing they should have accomplished by then?

### 💡 Preview: How I will translate this for your recruiter
Once you provide these answers, I will build a brief that includes a **"Plain English Glossary"** for them. For example:

*   **Instead of "Organizational Design,"** I will tell them: *"Look for someone who knows how to move boxes around on an org chart to make the team run faster without making everyone quit."*
*   **Instead of "Calibration Sessions,"** I will tell them: *"This is a meeting where managers argue about who gets a bonus; the HRBP needs to be the 'referee' to make sure it's fair."*

**Please provide the answers to the questions above, and I will draft the final comprehensive brief!**
