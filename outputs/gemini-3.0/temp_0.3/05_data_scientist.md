This is a high-stakes role. In the world of FinTech, a Senior Data Scientist isn't just "writing code"—they are building the engines that decide who gets money and who is trying to steal it.

To help your non-technical recruiter find the "needle in the haystack," I need to move past the buzzwords and understand the **human and business reality** of this role.

Please answer the following questions. Once you do, I will synthesize them into a "Recruiter’s Cheat Sheet" that explains the role so simply even someone with zero tech background can screen candidates effectively.

### 1. The "Why" (The Hook)
*   **The Problem:** What is the single biggest problem this person will solve in their first 6 months? (e.g., "Our fraud rate is too high," or "Our current models are 'black boxes' and the government is asking questions.")
*   **The Impact:** If this person is successful, how does the company change?
*   **The Pitch:** Why would a Senior Data Scientist leave a stable job at a giant like Google or JPMorgan to come here? Is it the data scale, the autonomy, or the specific mission?

### 2. The Technical "Must-Haves" vs. "Nice-to-Haves"
*   **The "Big Three":** If a candidate is amazing at Python and SQL but has never used Spark/Databricks, is that a dealbreaker?
*   **The Math:** Do they need to be "Research Scientists" (inventing new math) or "Applied Scientists" (using existing tools to solve business problems)?
*   **The Regulatory Piece:** The JD mentions FCRA and ECOA. How critical is it that they already know these laws, or can they learn them on the job?

### 3. The "Day in the Life" (Context)
*   **The Data:** You mention "billions of records." Is this data clean and organized, or will this person spend 70% of their time "cleaning" messy data?
*   **Production:** Does this person just build the model and hand it off to an engineer, or are they expected to actually "deploy" it (put it into the live app) themselves?
*   **The Team:** Who do they report to, and how many junior scientists will they actually be mentoring?

### 4. The Candidate Persona
*   **Target Companies:** Which companies are "talent goldmines" for you? (e.g., "Look for people from Stripe, Affirm, or Capital One.")
*   **The "Anti-Persona":** Who looks good on paper but fails in your culture? (e.g., "We don't want academics who can't meet a deadline," or "We don't want people who only want to work on Neural Networks.")
*   **Education:** Is the MS/PhD a hard requirement, or will you take someone with a Bachelor’s and 8+ years of incredible experience?

### 5. Screening "Cheat Codes" for the Recruiter
*   **The "Killer" Question:** What is one question the recruiter can ask in a 15-minute phone screen to tell if the candidate is actually a "Senior" vs. just a "Mid-level" dev?
*   **Red Flags:** What is one specific buzzword or phrase a candidate might say that should make the recruiter worried?

### 6. Logistics & Process
*   **The Interview Loop:** What does the process look like? (e.g., Recruiter screen -> Hiring Manager call -> Take-home test -> Panel).
*   **Sponsorship:** Can you hire someone on an H1-B visa, or must they be a US Citizen/Green Card holder?
*   **Remote Work:** Is "Remote US-based" strict? Can they live in any state (due to tax nexus)?
