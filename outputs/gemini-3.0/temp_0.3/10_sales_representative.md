This is a high-stakes hire. An Enterprise Sales Rep with a $2M quota and a $350k OTE is a "heavy hitter" role. To ensure your external recruiter doesn't waste your time with "resume flicking" (sending candidates who look good on paper but can't close), I need to help them understand the **nuance** of the role.

Before I write the final brief, please answer the following questions. Your answers will allow me to translate the "corporate speak" of the JD into a "scouting map" for the recruiter.

### 1. The "Elevator Pitch" (Selling the Role)
*   **Why would a top performer leave a company like Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, or Zscaler to come here?** (Is it the equity upside? The lack of bureaucracy? A specific feature our product has that others don't?)
*   **What is the "pain point" we solve in one sentence?** (e.g., "We stop hackers from stealing data when companies move their files to the cloud.")

### 2. Defining the "Hunter" DNA
*   **Is this 100% "Greenfield"?** Will the recruiter be given a list of accounts, or are they starting with a blank map of the Western US?
*   **What does "Resilience" look like here?** Is the hardest part getting the first meeting, or is it keeping the deal alive during the 12-month technical evaluation?

### 3. The Technical "Translation"
*   **The JD mentions "SIEM" and "Threat Detection."** In layman's terms, are we a "burglar alarm" (detecting an intruder) or a "vault" (preventing them from getting in)?
*   **How technical does the salesperson actually need to be?** Do they need to be able to explain how an API works, or do they just need to be "tech-curious" and let the Sales Engineer handle the deep stuff?

### 4. The Ideal Candidate Profile (The "Who")
*   **Target Companies:** Name 3-5 companies where the "perfect" candidate is working right now.
*   **The "DNA" Split:** Do you prefer a "Relationship Builder" (someone who plays golf with CISOs) or a "Challenger" (someone who tells the CISO their current strategy is wrong)?
*   **Education vs. Experience:** If a candidate has 10 years of elite cybersecurity sales but no Bachelor’s degree, is that a dealbreaker?

### 5. Sales Methodology & Process
*   **MEDDIC:** The JD mentions MEDDIC. For the recruiter’s sake, do you require them to have *used* it formally, or just understand the concept of qualifying a deal?
*   **The "Champion":** In your experience, who is the person at the client company who usually "signs off" on CloudSecure? (e.g., The Head of Infrastructure? The Chief Security Officer?)

### 6. Territory & Logistics
*   **The "Western US" is huge.** Is there a preference for someone in the Bay Area (near HQ) or someone in Seattle/Denver to cover those hubs?
*   **Travel:** It says 30-40%. Is this "day trips" or "gone for a week at a time"?

### 7. Red Flags (The "Who NOT to hire")
*   What is a common reason candidates fail the interview at CloudSecure?
*   Are there certain companies whose sales culture is the "opposite" of yours? (e.g., "We don't want people from Oracle because they are too used to having a massive brand name behind them.")

**Please provide as much detail as you can for these points. Once you do, I will draft a brief that explains the role so clearly that even a recruiter with zero tech background will be able to headhunt the right people.**
