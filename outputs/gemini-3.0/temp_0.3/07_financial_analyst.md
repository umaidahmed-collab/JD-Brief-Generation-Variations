This is a great starting point. To transform this Job Description into a "Recruiter-Proof" brief, I need to dig into the nuances that aren't on the page. 

Because your recruiter is non-technical and external, they need to know not just **what** the person does, but **why** it matters and **how** to spot the difference between a "paper-qualified" candidate and a "top-tier" candidate.

Please answer the following questions. Once you provide these details, I will draft the comprehensive brief for you.

### 1. The "Why" and the Context
*   **Why is this role open?** Is this a new headcount due to the 25% growth, or are you replacing someone? (If replacing, what did the previous person lack?)
*   **The "Cloud Services" focus:** The JD mentions partnering with the Cloud division. Is this the fastest-growing part of the company? What is the biggest challenge that division is facing right now (e.g., high costs, unpredictable revenue, scaling issues)?

### 2. Simplifying the Technical Skills
*   **The "SaaS" Factor:** You mentioned CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) and LTV (Lifetime Value). If a candidate comes from a traditional manufacturing background, is that a dealbreaker? Or is "SaaS experience" a hard requirement?
*   **The Tools:** You listed several tools (Adaptive, Anaplan, Hyperion). Which one do you **actually** use today? Does the candidate need to be an "admin" (someone who builds the tool) or just a "power user" (someone who enters data and runs reports)?
*   **Excel Test:** Will there be a technical Excel test? If so, what is the one specific function they *must* know how to do (e.g., Three-Statement Modeling, Data Manipulation)?

### 3. The "Business Partner" Persona
*   **The C-Suite Interaction:** This role reports to executives. Does the candidate need to be "polished and formal," or "scrappy and direct"? 
*   **The "Cloud" Stakeholders:** Who are the leaders of the Cloud division? Are they "finance-friendly," or does this Analyst need to be someone who can "push back" and hold them accountable to a budget?

### 4. Cultural Fit & Soft Skills
*   **The "TechCorp" Vibe:** Is the office environment more like a "suit and tie" bank or a "hoodie and sneakers" startup?
*   **The "Proactive" Requirement:** Can you give an example of a "proactive" thing this person would do in their first 90 days? (e.g., "Fix a broken spreadsheet that everyone hates.")

### 5. Sourcing & "The Hook"
*   **Target Companies:** If you could steal a candidate from any three companies in Austin or the tech world, who would they be?
*   **The "Anti-Profile":** Who looks good on paper but would fail at TechCorp? (e.g., "Someone who needs a step-by-step manual," or "Someone who only wants to do data entry and never talk to people.")
*   **The Pitch:** Besides the salary, what is the #1 reason a Senior Analyst at a competitor would want *this* specific job? (e.g., "You get to help prep for Board meetings," or "We are about to go through a massive M&A.")

### 6. Logistics
*   **The Hybrid Policy:** Is "2-3 days" a strict rule, or is it flexible? 
*   **The Interview Process:** What are the steps? (e.g., Recruiter screen -> Hiring Manager -> Case Study -> Panel). Knowing this helps the recruiter "sell" the timeline to the candidate.

**Once you provide these answers, I will create a brief that explains things like "Revenue Recognition" and "Variance Analysis" in a way that your recruiter can explain to a candidate with total confidence.**
