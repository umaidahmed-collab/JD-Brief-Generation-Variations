This is a fascinating role. You aren't just looking for a "developer"; you are looking for a **"Technical Fixer"** or a **"Product Stabilizer."** 

Because your recruiter is external and non-technical, they might fall into the trap of just looking for keywords like "React" or "Python." To prevent this, I need to help them understand the **temperament** and **context** of the person you need, not just their coding skills.

To build the ultimate recruiter brief, please answer the following questions. Don't worry about using technical language—I will "translate" your answers into the final simple-English brief.

### 1. The "Why" & The Big Picture
*   **The "Elevator Pitch":** In two sentences, what does D50 AI actually do for its customers? (e.g., "It’s a tool that lets businesses send automated AI voice calls to their leads to book appointments.")
*   **The "Pain Point":** What is the biggest problem the founder is facing right now because this role is empty? (e.g., "The system crashes when 10 people use it at once," or "We can't change anything without breaking the whole site.")

### 2. The Tech Stack (The "Must-Haves" vs. "Nice-to-Haves")
*   **The Language:** The JD mentions Node.js and Python. Which one is the *actual* core of the current platform? Does the candidate need to be an expert in both, or just one?
*   **The "Mess" Factor:** You mentioned an "imperfect codebase." On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being "clean but undocumented" and 10 being "a total disaster written by someone who didn't know what they were doing"), how messy is it?
*   **The Telephony Piece:** Twilio/Telnyx experience is quite niche. Is this a "deal-breaker" if they don't have it, or can a very smart backend engineer learn it in a week?

### 3. The Candidate Profile (Soft Skills)
*   **The "Detective" Mindset:** This role requires "untangling systems." Have you ever hired someone who failed at this? What did they do wrong? (This helps me tell the recruiter what "red flags" to look for).
*   **Autonomy:** Will this person be the *only* engineer for a while, or do they have a team? 
*   **The Founder Relationship:** The JD says the founder needs "execution, not theory." Does this mean the founder is very fast-paced? Do they want someone who says "Yes" and does it, or someone who says "No, that's a bad idea, here is why"?

### 4. The AI Component
*   **The Reality of AI:** Many candidates claim "AI experience" because they used ChatGPT. For this role, they need to connect APIs (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.). Do they need to know how to *build* AI models, or do they just need to be experts at *connecting* different AI tools together like LEGO blocks?

### 5. Logistics & Selling Points
*   **The "Hook":** Why would a top-tier engineer leave a stable job to come "fix a mess" at D50 AI? Is it the equity? The total remote freedom? The chance to be a future CTO?
*   **Geography/Timezone:** "Fully remote" is great, but do they need to overlap with a specific timezone (e.g., US Eastern or UK time) for meetings with the founder?
*   **The Interview Process:** Briefly, what will the steps be? (e.g., 1. Recruiter Screen, 2. Founder Chat, 3. Technical Review/Audit of the code).

**Once you provide these details, I will draft a brief that explains:**
1.  **What the company actually does** (in plain English).
2.  **The "Mission"** (Why this isn't a normal coding job).
3.  **A "Translation Guide"** for the recruiter (e.g., *“If a candidate says they love 'Greenfield' projects, they are the WRONG person. You want someone who uses the word 'Refactoring' or 'Optimization'.”*)
4.  **Specific "Screening Questions"** the recruiter can ask to filter out people who are just keyword-matching.
