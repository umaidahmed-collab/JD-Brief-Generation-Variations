Okay, this is an excellent starting point! The job description clearly lays out a challenging and impactful role. To create a truly comprehensive brief for your external, non-technical recruiter, I need to understand a lot more. My goal is to equip them with *all* the context, nuances, and selling points so they can effectively pitch the role and identify the right candidates, even without a technical background.

Let's start with the questions. Please answer these as thoroughly as possible. Your answers will form the backbone of the detailed brief.

### **My Questions for You (The Hiring Manager) - Please Answer in Detail:**

**I. About Division50 (The Company Context):**

1.  **What does Division50 do, in simple terms?** Imagine explaining it to a friend who doesn't work in tech. What problem does your company solve, and for whom?
    *   *Example: "We help small businesses automate their customer support using AI-powered chatbots."*
2.  **What is the D50 AI platform, specifically?** What does it enable users to do? What's its primary function or use case?
    *   *Example: "D50 AI is a platform that allows sales teams to create and manage automated outbound calling campaigns using AI voices."*
3.  **What is the company's vision or long-term goal?** Where do you see Division50 in 1, 3, 5 years?
4.  **How big is Division50 currently?** (Number of employees, especially in engineering/tech).
5.  **What stage is the company at?** (e.g., very early-stage startup, seed-funded, Series A, profitable and growing, etc.). This helps the recruiter understand the risk/reward profile.
6.  **What is the overall company culture like?** Beyond "fully remote" and "no micromanagement," describe the working atmosphere. Is it fast-paced, collaborative, independent, experimental, structured? What are the core values?
7.  **Why is this role open now?** (e.g., rapid growth, a new strategic direction, the founder needs to offload technical burden, etc.).
8.  **Who will this person report directly to?** (Presumably you, the founder, but confirm). What is your working style?
9.  **Who else will this person collaborate with?** (e.g., other engineers, sales, product, marketing, you the founder). How many people are on the technical team currently?

**II. About the Role (The Opportunity & Challenges):**

10. **What does "production-ready" mean for D50 AI?** What are the *current* biggest pain points or frustrations with the platform that this person will solve? (e.g., "It crashes daily," "It's too slow," "We can't onboard new users reliably," "Deploying new features is a nightmare").
11. **"Inherit an imperfect codebase, partial documentation."** Can you elaborate on the *degree* of imperfection?
    *   Is it mostly functional but messy, or is it frequently breaking?
    *   Roughly what percentage of the codebase would you consider "imperfect" or needing refactoring?
    *   What kind of "partial documentation" exists? (e.g., some READMEs, scattered notes, nothing formal).
12. **"Founder who needs execution, not theory."** What does this mean in practice for the working relationship? What kind of communication and output do you expect?
13. **What does "full technical ownership" truly entail for this role?** What level of autonomy and decision-making power will this person have over the platform's architecture, tools, and processes?
14. **What does success look like in the first 30, 60, 90 days, and 6 months?**
    *   *30 days:* "Understands the system, identifies key issues."
    *   *60 days:* "Starts fixing critical bugs, stabilizes core flows."
    *   *90 days:* "Platform is more reliable, new users can be onboarded."
    *   *6 months:* "Platform is stable, scalable, and ready for significant growth, with clear documentation."
15. **What is the approximate size/complexity of the D50 AI platform today?** (e.g., number of microservices, size of the user base if any, number of features).
16. **Why is this such an exciting or unique opportunity for the right candidate?** (Beyond the challenge, what's the growth potential, impact, learning opportunity?)

**III. Compensation & Logistics:**

17. **What is the salary range you are targeting for this role?** (Crucial for the recruiter to screen effectively).
18. **Are you offering equity/stock options?** If so, can you provide a general overview of the equity package?

21. **What is the ideal start date or timeframe for this hire?**

**IV. Candidate Profile & Interview Process:**

22. **What are the absolute non-negotiable skills or experiences?** If a candidate doesn't have X, they are automatically out. (Be very specific).
23. **What are the "strong preferences" or "highly desirable" skills/experiences?** (Things that would make a candidate stand out).
24. **Beyond technical skills, what kind of personality traits, working style, and mindset are you looking for?**
    *   (e.g., highly autonomous, proactive, problem-solver, resilient, curious, pragmatic, excellent communicator, comfortable with ambiguity, self-starter).
25. **What are some "red flags" or personality types that would *not* be a good fit for this role or company culture?** (e.g., "needs constant direction," "avoids getting hands dirty," "only interested in greenfield," "theory over execution").
26. **What is the interview process like?**
