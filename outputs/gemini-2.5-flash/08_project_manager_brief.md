Okay, this is a fantastic request! My goal is to equip your external recruiter with such a deep understanding that they can confidently talk to candidates, answer their initial questions, and truly qualify them beyond just keywords on a resume.

To do that, I'm going to ask you a series of questions. Please answer them as thoroughly as you can. Don't worry about sounding "professional" – just tell me everything you know and feel about the role, the team, and BuildRight. The more detail, the better!

### **My Initial Questions to You (Part 1: The Company & Culture)**

Let's start with the big picture, as your recruiter needs to understand where this role fits in and what it's like to work at BuildRight.

1.  **"About BuildRight" - Beyond the Numbers:**
    *   You mention $800M annual revenue and 200+ projects. That's impressive! What's the *vibe* at BuildRight? Is it fast-paced, collaborative, innovative, traditional, family-oriented, highly structured, entrepreneurial?
    *   What are 2-3 things that genuinely make BuildRight a great place to work, from an employee's perspective? What keeps people there?
    *   What's the biggest challenge or pain point that employees at BuildRight often face (e.g., rapid growth, tight deadlines, complex projects, specific market pressures)?
    *   How would you describe the leadership style within the company? (e.g., hands-on, empowering, strategic, collaborative?)
    *   What's the company's long-term vision or strategic goal that this Senior Project Manager would contribute to?

2.  **Team & Department Context:**
    *   Who will this Senior Project Manager report directly to? What's their title and management style? (e.g., VP of Operations, Director of Construction, etc.)
    *   How many other Senior Project Managers are there currently? What's the typical size of a project team (Assistant PMs, Superintendents, etc.) that this person would lead?
    *   What's the overall structure of the project management team? Is it a flat structure or hierarchical?
    *   Why is this position open? (e.g., new role due to growth, replacing someone, expanding capacity for upcoming projects?)

3.  **"Selling BuildRight" to Candidates:**
    *   If you were trying to convince a top-tier Senior Project Manager to join BuildRight over a competitor, what would be your absolute strongest selling points? (Think beyond just salary and benefits – what's unique?)
    *   Are there specific growth opportunities for a Senior Project Manager within BuildRight? (e.g., moving into a Director role, specializing in certain project types, leading larger programs?)
    *   How does BuildRight support its employees' professional development and career goals?

Once I have your answers to these, I'll move on to more specific questions about the role itself, project types, technical skills, and candidate profile. This iterative approach will ensure we capture everything needed!
