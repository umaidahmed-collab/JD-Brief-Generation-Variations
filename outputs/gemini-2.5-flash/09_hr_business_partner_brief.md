Okay, this is an excellent approach! To create a truly comprehensive and effective brief for your external, non-technical recruiter, I need to ask you a series of detailed questions. Think of me as your recruiter, and I'm trying to understand *everything* I need to know to find the perfect match, not just what's on the job description.

The goal is to provide context, simplify technical terms, and give your recruiter a deep understanding of the role, the team, and the company culture.

Please take your time to answer these questions as thoroughly as possible. The more detail you provide, the better equipped your recruiter will be.

### **Questions to Build Your Comprehensive Recruiter Brief**

Let's break this down into categories to ensure we cover all bases:

---

### **Part 1: About GlobalTech Solutions (The "Why Us?" for Candidates)**

1.  **Simplifying "Cloud-based Solutions for Supply Chain Management":**
    *   Can you explain in very simple terms what GlobalTech Solutions *actually does*? Imagine explaining it to someone who knows nothing about enterprise software or supply chains. What problem do you solve for your customers?
    *   What kind of companies are your typical customers? (e.g., small businesses, large corporations, specific industries?)
    *   What makes your solutions unique or better than competitors?

2.  **"Best Place to Work" & Culture:**
    *   You've been recognized as a "Best Place to Work" for five years – that's fantastic! What specific aspects of GlobalTech's culture contribute to this recognition? (e.g., work-life balance, innovation, collaboration, diversity, leadership style, employee perks, impact on the world?)
    *   How would you describe the overall vibe or atmosphere at GlobalTech? (e.g., fast-paced, innovative, collaborative, supportive, demanding, casual, formal?)
    *   What are 2-3 things that an employee would *love* about working at GlobalTech?
    *   Are there any common misconceptions about working in a large tech company that you'd want to address?

3.  **"Significant Growth and Transformation":**
    *   Can you elaborate on what this growth and transformation entails? What are the key drivers? (e.g., entering new markets, launching new products, expanding geographically, acquiring other companies, shifting business models?)
    *   How does this growth and transformation impact employees day-to-day? What challenges and opportunities does it create for an HRBP?

4.  **Company Values in Action:**
    *   What are GlobalTech's core values? (If you have them, please list them).
    *   More importantly, how do these values *show up* in the daily work environment, leadership decisions, and employee interactions? Can you give an example of a value in action?

### **Part 2: About the Engineering & Product Organizations (The "Who You'll Support")**

1.  **Structure & Scope:**
    *   You mentioned 800 employees. How are these 800 employees typically structured? Are they in many small teams, a few large departments, or a mix?
    *   What's the general breakdown between Engineering and Product? (e.g., 600 Eng, 200 Prod or 400/400?)
    *   Are these teams mostly co-located, distributed across different offices, or fully remote? (This impacts how the HRBP will interact).
    *   What are the key functions or types of roles within Engineering (e.g., software engineers, QA, DevOps, architects) and Product (e.g., product managers, UX/UI designers, product owners)?

2.  **Leadership & Culture within Eng/Prod:**
    *   What are the leadership styles of the VP of Engineering and VP of Product? (e.g., hands-on, delegating, strategic, empowering, data-driven, people-focused?)
    *   What are their biggest priorities or challenges right now that this HRBP will help them with?
    *   How would you describe the culture *within* Engineering and Product? Is it different from the broader company culture in any significant way? (e.g., more analytical, more creative, faster-paced, more structured?)
    *   What are the typical pain points or opportunities within these organizations that an HRBP would be expected to address? (e.g., scaling teams, retaining top talent, fostering innovation, improving cross-functional collaboration?)

### **Part 3: The HR Business Partner Role (The "What You'll Do & How You'll Succeed")**

    *   Who will this HR Business Partner report directly to? (e.g., Head of HR, Senior HRBP, CHRO?)
    *   Will they be part of a larger HRBP team, or will they be the sole HRBP for these organizations?

    *   What does "strategic" look like day-to-day for this HRBP? Can you give 2-3 concrete examples of strategic initiatives or projects they might lead or significantly contribute to in their first year?
    *   What's the balance between strategic work and more operational/tactical work? (e.g., 70% strategic / 30% operational, or 50/50?) Recruiters need to know if it's a "hands-on" strategic role or purely advisory.

    *   **Change Management:** Given the "growth and transformation," what kind of changes might this HRBP be leading or supporting? (e.g., integrating an acquired company, rolling out a new performance management system, supporting a large-scale reorganization). Are there specific methodologies or tools used for change management?
    *   **M&A Integration:** Have there been recent M&A activities, or are there anticipated ones? What would the HRBP's specific involvement be in integrating people and culture?
    *   **Data-Driven Insights & HR Analytics:** What kind of data will this HRBP typically analyze? What tools do you use for HR reporting and analytics? (e.g., Workday reports, Excel, specific HR analytics dashboards). What kind of insights are most valuable to your leaders?
