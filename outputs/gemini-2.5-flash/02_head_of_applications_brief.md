Okay, this is an excellent approach! To help your external recruiter find the absolute best candidate for this critical Head of Applications Service Management role, I need to gather a lot more context and detail than just what's in the Job Description.

Think of me as your internal partner, asking all the questions a good recruiter *should* ask before starting a search.

Let's break this down. I'll go through the JD and then ask you comprehensive questions about the company, the role, the team, and the ideal candidate.

---

### **Initial Read-Through & Clarifications from the Job Description (for my understanding, before I ask you questions):**

From the JD, I understand this role is about:
*   **Leading a team** that supports, maintains, and improves a central business system called **ADERP** (Abu Dhabi Enterprise Resource Planning) and other important company applications.
*   Ensuring these systems are **stable, performant, and reliable** so the business can run smoothly.
*   **Defining how support works** for these systems (the "service operations model").
*   **Building strong relationships** with government stakeholders (which sounds important and unique).
*   **Managing day-to-day support** (incidents, problems, requests) using best practices (ITIL).
*   **Tracking how well services are doing** (KPIs, SLAs) and always looking for ways to make them better.
*   **Working with external vendors** who provide these systems or support.
*   **Managing a team** of various technical and support roles.
*   **Requiring someone with significant experience** (8-10 years in IT service management, 5+ in a leadership role).
*   **Needing expertise in a major ERP system** (like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics – but specifically ADERP here).
*   **ITIL experience is essential.**

### **My Questions for You (to build the comprehensive brief):**

Please answer these questions as thoroughly as possible. Don't worry about sounding technical; explain it to me like I'm a smart friend who just doesn't know your company or industry.

---

**PART 1: Understanding Your Company & Its Context**

1.  **What does your company/organization do?** (e.g., Are you a government entity, a private company, in finance, energy, healthcare, etc.? What's your mission or primary function?)
2.  **What is the overall culture like?** (e.g., Fast-paced, collaborative, formal, innovative, bureaucratic, stable, dynamic, startup-like?)
3.  **Why is this role so important right now?** What problem are you trying to solve, or what strategic goal will this person help you achieve?
4.  **Can you tell me more about "Abu Dhabi Enterprise Resource Planning (ADERP) system"?**
    *   Is it a custom-built system, or is it a specific version/implementation of one of the major Tier 1 ERPs (like SAP S/4HANA, Oracle NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O)? If it's one of these, which one?
    *   What are the most critical business functions that ADERP supports? (e.g., Finance, HR, Supply Chain, Operations, etc.?)
    *   How complex is it? Is it integrated with many other systems?
    *   When was it implemented, and what's its general "health" or maturity level?
5.  **What are these "other critical enterprise applications" mentioned?** Can you give me a few examples? Are they equally important, or is ADERP the main focus?
6.  **What does "government entities" mean in your context?** Are these internal government departments, external agencies, or both? What kind of relationship management is involved here? (e.g., Compliance, reporting, collaboration on shared services?)

**PART 2: Deep Dive into the Role & Team**

7.  **Who will this Head of Applications Service Management report directly to?** (e.g., CIO, Head of IT Operations, CTO?) What is their leadership style like?
8.  **Is this a new role, or is someone leaving?**
    *   If new, why was it created now?
    *   If replacing someone, why did the previous person leave? What did they do well, and where were the opportunities for improvement?
9.  **Tell me about the team this person will lead.**
    *   How many people are currently in the team?
    *   What are their general skill sets and experience levels? (e.g., junior, mid, senior specialists?)
    *   What's the current team structure? (e.g., do they have team leads, or does everyone report directly to this role?)
    *   What are the team's strengths? What are their areas for development?
    *   What's the team's morale like?
10. **What are the biggest challenges this person will face in their first 6-12 months?** (e.g., Legacy systems, understaffed team, complex integrations, demanding stakeholders, lack of clear processes?)
11. **What would "success" look like for this person in their first year?** (e.g., Improved system uptime, reduced incident resolution time, happier stakeholders, a stronger team, new processes implemented?)
12. **What kind of leadership style thrives in this environment?** (e.g., Hands-on, strategic, collaborative, authoritative, empowering?)
13. **Regarding "ITIL best practices":** What is the current maturity level of ITIL adoption within the team/organization? Is this person expected to *implement* ITIL from scratch, or refine existing processes?
14. **What are the key external vendors this person will manage?** (e.g., Specific ERP vendor, cloud provider, other software partners). What is the current state of these relationships?
15. **How much technical depth is truly required?** While it's a leadership role, will they need to roll up their sleeves and troubleshoot occasionally, or is it purely strategic and managerial?

**PART 3: Ideal Candidate Profile & Logistics**

16. **Beyond the technical skills, what are the absolute "must-have" soft skills or personality traits for this role?** (e.g., Resilience, political savviness, excellent negotiation, calm under pressure, ability to influence without direct authority?)
17. **What's the most important thing you want the recruiter to look for when screening candidates?** What's the one thing that would make a candidate stand out (or immediately disqualify them)?
18. **What's the typical compensation range (base salary + any bonuses) for this role?** (This is crucial for recruiters to manage candidate expectations.)
19. **What are the key benefits offered?** (e.g., Health insurance, vacation days, pension, professional development budget, relocation support if applicable).
20. **What's the work location?** (e.g., Fully on-site in Abu Dhabi, hybrid, remote?) If hybrid, what's the expectation for office presence?
21. **What does the interview process typically look like?** (e.g., How many stages, who will they meet at each stage, is there a technical assessment or presentation?)
22. **What are the biggest selling points of this role and your company to a top candidate?** Why should someone leave their current job for this opportunity? (e.g., Impact, growth potential, cutting-edge technology, strong culture, stability, unique mission?)
23. **Are there any "red flags" or types of candidates we should actively avoid?** (e.g., purely technical without leadership, someone who avoids stakeholder management, only focused on one specific ERP?)
