## **Recruiter Brief: Senior Financial Analyst - Corporate FP&A**

**Role:** Senior Financial Analyst - Corporate FP&A
**Company:** TechCorp Industries
**Location:** Austin, Texas (Hybrid - 2-3 days in office)

---

### **1. About TechCorp Industries (The Big Picture for Candidates)**

*   **What we do:** TechCorp Industries is a major technology company. Think of us as a big umbrella covering three main areas:
    *   **Enterprise Software:** We create and sell software solutions for large businesses.
    *   **Cloud Services:** We offer services where companies can store their data and run their applications over the internet (like Google Drive or Amazon Web Services, but for businesses).
    *   **Hardware Solutions:** We also develop and sell physical technology products.
*   **Our Size & Success:** We're a very successful company, generating **$2.5 billion in revenue each year**. We're also growing rapidly, expanding by 25% year-over-year. This growth is why we need more talented people like this Senior Financial Analyst to join our team.
*   **Publicly Traded:** We are a "publicly traded" company, meaning our shares are bought and sold on the stock market (NASDAQ: TECH). This is important because it means we have specific financial reporting responsibilities to our investors and the public every quarter.

### **2. Why This Role is Open & Why It Matters (The Impact)**

*   **Why we're hiring:** TechCorp is growing fast, and with that growth comes more financial data and more strategic decisions to make. We need to expand our Finance team to keep up and ensure we're making smart choices about where to invest our money and how to plan for the future.
*   **What this role does:** This Senior Financial Analyst will be a critical part of our **Corporate FP&A team**.
    *   **What is FP&A?** FP&A stands for "Financial Planning & Analysis." In simple terms, this team acts like the company's financial GPS. They look at where the company is financially, where it wants to go, and help create the roadmap to get there. They're not just looking at past numbers; they're actively shaping the future.
    *   **What does "Corporate" mean?** This means the role supports the entire company's financial strategy, not just one specific product or department. They'll be working with leaders across all our business segments (Software, Cloud, Hardware) and directly with our top executives.
*   **Impact:** This person won't just be crunching numbers; they'll be a strategic partner, providing insights that directly influence big company decisions. They'll help set budgets, predict future financial performance, and analyze the health of our business units.

### **3. Who This Role Reports To & Works With**

*   **Reporting Structure:** *(I'll need to ask you about this!)*
*   **Key Relationships:** This role works very closely with:
    *   **Business Unit Leaders:** The heads of our Enterprise Software, Cloud Services, and Hardware Solutions divisions.
    *   **C-suite Executives:** Our top leadership team, including the CEO (Chief Executive Officer), CFO (Chief Financial Officer), etc.
    *   **Cloud Services Division Leadership:** This role will specifically act as a financial advisor to the leaders of our Cloud Services business.
    *   **Accounting Team:** They'll partner with the accounting department, who are responsible for recording the company's financial transactions.
    *   **Junior Team Members:** They may also help mentor or train less experienced analysts.

### **4. What This Person Will Actually Do (Key Responsibilities - Simplified)**

This role has four main areas of responsibility:

**A. Financial Planning & Analysis (The "Financial GPS" Part):**

*   **Annual Budgeting:** They will lead the process of creating the yearly financial plan (the "budget") for specific parts of our business, which are quite large (over $500 million in revenue). This involves working with various teams to figure out how much money they'll need and how much revenue they expect to generate.
*   **Quarterly Forecasting:** Every three months, they'll update these plans, predicting what our financial performance will look like in the near future. They'll also compare these predictions to the actual results and explain any differences ("variance analysis").
*   **Financial Modeling:** They'll build sophisticated spreadsheets and tools ("financial models") to test different business scenarios. For example, "What if we launched a new product? How would that impact our revenue?" or "What if our sales grow faster/slower than expected?" ("scenario planning" and "sensitivity analysis").
*   **Long-Range Planning:** They'll help develop financial plans that look 3-5 years into the future, making sure they align with the company's overall strategic goals.
*   **Key Metric Analysis:** They'll analyze important numbers that tell us how healthy our business is. These include:
    *   **Revenue Growth:** How fast our sales are increasing.
    *   **Margins:** How much profit we make from each sale after covering costs.
    *   **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** How much it costs us to get a new customer.
    *   **LTV (Lifetime Value):** How much revenue we expect to get from a customer over their entire relationship with us.
    *   **Unit Economics:** The revenue and cost associated with a single unit of our product or service. (e.g., how much does one software license cost to produce vs. sell?)

**B. Reporting & Presentations (Translating Numbers into Stories):**

*   **Executive Reports:** They'll create easy-to-understand monthly financial reports for our top executives and our Board of Directors (the group overseeing the company).
*   **Compelling Presentations:** They won't just present raw data; they'll create engaging presentations that explain what the numbers mean and what actions we should take based on them.
*   **Investor Relations Support:** Because we're a public company, we regularly communicate with investors. This person will help prepare materials for our quarterly earnings calls, including presentations and answers to potential questions from investors.
*   **Automated Dashboards:** They'll develop automated visual reports (like interactive charts and graphs) using tools like **Tableau** and **Power BI** to make financial data easily accessible and understandable for everyone.

**C. Business Partnership (Being a Financial Advisor):**

*   **Cloud Services Advisor:** They will specifically act as the primary financial contact and advisor for the leaders of our Cloud Services division, helping them understand their financial performance and make smart decisions.
*   **Investment Evaluation:** They'll help evaluate new projects or investments to see if they are financially worthwhile ("Return on Investment" or "ROI"). This means figuring out if the money we put in will generate enough profit in return.
*   **Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) Support:** If TechCorp decides to buy another company (an "acquisition"), this person will help analyze the financial health of that company ("due diligence") and assist with combining their finances with ours ("integration planning").
*   **Month-End Close & Revenue Recognition:** They'll work with the accounting team to ensure our monthly financial books are closed accurately and help analyze how we record our sales ("revenue recognition"), especially complex ones.

**D. Process Improvement (Making Things Better):**

*   **Efficiency:** They'll look for ways to make our financial planning processes faster, smoother, and more accurate.
*   **New Tools:** They'll help implement new software and technologies that improve how we do financial planning.
*   **Best Practices & Training:** They'll document the best ways to do things and help train new or junior team members.

### **5. What We're Looking For (Skills & Experience Breakdown)**

**Must-Have Qualifications (Non-Negotiables):**

*   **Education:** Bachelor's degree in Finance, Accounting, Economics, or a closely related field.

    *   **Investment Banking:** Experience in a fast-paced environment analyzing companies for mergers, acquisitions, or other financial transactions.
