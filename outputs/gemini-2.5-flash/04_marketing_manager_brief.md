Okay, this is an excellent starting point! To create the most comprehensive and effective brief for your external recruiter – who is non-technical and doesn't know your company – I need to dig a lot deeper. The more context, nuance, and plain-language explanations you provide, the better they will be at identifying truly suitable candidates.

Please take your time to answer the following questions in as much detail as possible. Don't worry about being too verbose; every piece of information helps paint a clearer picture!

**Part 1: Understanding GreenLeaf Organics - The Heart of the Company**

1.  **Our Deeper Purpose & Philosophy:** You mentioned "organic and sustainable food products." What's the *true north* or core belief behind GreenLeaf Organics? What specific problem are you trying to solve for your customers or the planet? What makes your brand genuinely special and different from other organic food companies out there?
2.  **Our Culture & Values in Action:** Describe the typical day-to-day working environment. Is it very structured, or more agile and adaptable?

(e.g., innovation, customer-first, environmental stewardship, transparency, hustle, community).
3.  **Growth Journey & Future Vision:** You've grown quickly. What are the *biggest opportunities* or *challenges* GreenLeaf is currently facing that this Senior Marketing Manager will directly help address?

4.  **Marketing Team & Leadership Structure:**
    *   Who will this Senior Marketing Manager report to directly? (e.g., VP of Marketing, CEO, Head of Sales). What's their leadership style like? (e.g., hands-on, delegating, mentoring, strategic).
    *   How is the marketing department currently structured? How does the marketing team typically collaborate with other key departments like Sales, Product Development, and Operations? Are there any current communication challenges or successes you can highlight?

**Part 2: The Senior Marketing Manager Role - What Success Really Looks Like**

1.  **The "Why" Now?:** Is this a brand-new position due to rapid growth, or are they replacing someone who moved on? If new, what specific gap or opportunity prompted its creation? What *primary problem* will this person be hired to solve for GreenLeaf Organics?

3.  **Key Challenges & Opportunities in the Role:** What are the biggest hurdles, complexities, or exciting opportunities this Senior Marketing Manager will likely encounter? (e.g., navigating a highly competitive market, integrating new marketing technologies, building a stronger team, launching into new retail channels).
4.  **Autonomy & Influence:** How much freedom and decision-making power will this person have? Will they be expected to develop new strategies, or primarily execute existing ones? How much influence will they have on the overall company's strategic direction?

**Part 3: Deep Dive into Responsibilities - Explaining the "How" and "Why"**

Let's break down some of the responsibilities so the recruiter understands what they entail in your context:

1.  **Integrated Marketing Campaigns:**
    *   Can you give a *concrete, real-world example* of an integrated marketing campaign GreenLeaf has run successfully, or one you envision this person leading? (Think: "We launched our new organic snack bars by combining Instagram ads, a partnership with a fitness influencer, and a tasting event at Whole Foods.")
    *   Which marketing channels (digital ads, social media, in-store promotions, traditional media like radio/print) are currently the *most important* for GreenLeaf's growth, and why?
2.  **Budget Management ($2M+):**
    *   What's the current state of the marketing budget? Is it well-structured and documented, or will this person need to build and refine it significantly?
    *   What kind of "ROI analysis" is typically performed? (Meaning, how do you measure if your marketing spending is paying off? Is it simple tracking, or more complex data modeling?)
3.  **Team Leadership (4 marketing professionals):**
    *   Tell me a bit about the current team of 4 (social media specialists and content creators). What are their strengths? What areas might they need more development in?
    *   What *kind of leader* would best motivate, guide, and develop this specific team? (e.g., a hands-on coach, a strategic delegator, a creative mentor).
4.  **Product Launches (10+ new products annually):**
    *   What's the typical process for a new product launch at GreenLeaf? From when an idea starts to when it hits the shelves, what specific role does marketing play at each stage?
5.  **Social Media & Influencer Marketing:**
    *   What's GreenLeaf's current social media presence like? (e.g., "We have a strong Instagram presence but want to grow TikTok," or "We're just starting with influencer marketing").
    *   What are your specific goals for these channels? Are you looking for someone to build the influencer program from scratch, scale an existing one, or both?
6.  **Explaining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Simply:** For a non-technical recruiter, let's explain these terms in plain English as they relate to GreenLeaf:
    *   **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** What does this mean for GreenLeaf, and why is it important? (e.g., "This is how much it costs us to get one new customer. We need to keep it low so we can grow profitably.")
    *   **LTV (Lifetime Value):** What does this mean for GreenLeaf, and why is it important? (e.g., "This is the total amount of money we expect a customer to spend with us over their entire relationship. We want to increase this by making them loyal.")
    *   **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend):** What does this mean for GreenLeaf, and why is it important? (e.g., "This tells us how much money we get back for every dollar we spend on ads. We need to make sure our ads are profitable.")
7.  **Retail Marketing & In-Store Promotions:**
    *   What kind of retail partnerships do you currently have? (e.g., Whole Foods, Sprouts, major grocery chains, smaller independent stores).
    *   What does "coordinating with the sales team" look like in practice for these promotions? Can you give an example of a typical retail marketing activity this person would lead?

**Part 4: The Ideal Candidate - Beyond the Resume**

1.  **Absolute "Must-Haves" (Non-negotiables):** From the requirements list, which 2-3 are *truly deal-breakers*? If a candidate doesn't have these, you simply won't consider them.
2.  **CPG/FMCG Experience - The "Why":** Why is experience in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) or Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry so critical for this role at GreenLeaf? Are there specific types of CPG experience that are more valuable than others (e.g., food & beverage, health products, perishable goods, specific retail channels)?
3.  **Leadership Style & Qualities:** Beyond just "managing direct reports," what specific leadership qualities are you looking for in this manager? (e.g., strategic thinker, empowering, analytical, creative, inspiring, decisive, collaborative).
4.  **Analytical Skills in Action:** Beyond knowing specific tools (Google Analytics, Tableau), what *kind of thinking* are you looking for? How will they use data and these tools day-to-day to make marketing decisions and improve campaigns? (e.g., "They need to look at data, understand *why* something is happening, and then propose a solution.")
5.  **Cultural Fit & Personality - The "Thrivers":** Describe the ideal personality and work style. What kind of person thrives and is most successful at GreenLeaf Organics? What kind of person might struggle in your environment?
6.  **Red Flags/Deal Breakers:** Are there any specific experiences, work styles, or personality traits that would immediately signal a poor fit for GreenLeaf Organics or this role?

**Part 5: Interview Process & Logistics**

1.  **Interview Stages:** Can you outline the typical steps in your interview process for this role? (e.g., Recruiter phone screen, Hiring Manager interview, Panel interview, Case Study/Presentation, Final Executive interview).
2.  **Who is involved at each stage?** (e.g., "Stage 2 will be with [Hiring Manager's Name/Title] and [Another Person's Name/Title]").
3.  **Desired Timeline:** What's your ideal timeframe for reviewing candidates, conducting interviews, and making a final hiring decision?
4.  **Hybrid Model Clarification:** What does the "3 days in office" look like in practice? Are there specific mandatory days (e.g., Tuesday-Thursday), or is it flexible for the employee to choose?
