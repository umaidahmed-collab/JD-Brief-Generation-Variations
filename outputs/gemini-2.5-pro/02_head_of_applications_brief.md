Excellent. This is exactly the right approach. Before I can create a truly effective brief, I need to understand the nuances that aren't on the page. A great recruiter doesn't just match keywords; they understand the story, the culture, and the real problems the candidate will be hired to solve.

Please answer the following questions as best you can. Your answers will allow me to craft a brief that turns your external recruiter into a true extension of your team.

### **Part 1: Clarifying Questions for You (The Hiring Manager)**

**Section A: About the Company & The "Why"**

1.  **Company Context:** The JD mentions "government entities." Is your organization a government department, a semi-government entity, or a private company that serves the government? This context is crucial for understanding the culture and stakeholder dynamics.
2.  **The ADERP System:** What exactly is "ADERP"? Is it a custom-built system, or is it a specific version of a major ERP like SAP or Oracle that has been configured for Abu Dhabi government use? This detail is critical.
3.  **Reason for Hiring:** Why is this role open now? Is it a new position created due to growth? Or are you backfilling someone who left? (If so, what made the previous person successful, or what was lacking?)
4.  **The Big Picture Goal:** What is the single biggest problem you hope this person will solve in their first 12 months? (e.g., "Our system is unstable and crashes a lot," "Our business users are unhappy with the support they get," or "We have no formal processes, and it's chaos.")

**Section B: The Role & The Team**

5.  **Team Structure:** How large is the team this person will lead? What is the breakdown of roles (e.g., 3 support analysts, 1 service manager, 2 administrators)? Are they internal employees, contractors, or managed service providers?
6.  **Reporting Line:** Who will this person report to? What is that person's title and background (e.g., CTO, Director of IT)? What is their leadership style?
7.  **Key Stakeholders:** Besides "senior Government stakeholders," who are the most important internal people this person will work with daily? (e.g., Head of Finance, Head of HR, Head of Infrastructure).
8.  **Success Metrics:** How will you measure success for this person beyond the KPIs mentioned? What would make you say "Wow, we hired the perfect person" in six months?

**Section C: The "Must-Haves" vs. "Nice-to-Haves"**

9.  **ERP Experience:** The JD lists SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics. Is there a preference? If a candidate has 15 years of deep Oracle experience but your ADERP is based on SAP, are they still a good fit? How important is experience with your *specific* system?
10. **Government Experience:** Is experience working *for* or *with* government entities a non-negotiable "must-have," or could a strong leader from a large, complex private corporation (like a bank or a major retailer) be successful?
11. **ITIL & Technical Skills:** How hands-on does this person need to be? Are you looking for a pure-play manager and strategist, or do they need to be able to jump in and help troubleshoot a major incident? How critical is the ITIL certification vs. just proven experience using the framework?
12. **Soft Skills Priority:** If you had to choose, what is the #1 most important soft skill for this role: Diplomatic stakeholder management, inspirational team leadership, or calm-under-pressure crisis management?

**Section D: Logistics**

13. **Salary & Benefits:** What is the approved salary range for this position? Are there any significant benefits to highlight (e.g., bonus structure, education allowance, family benefits)?
14. **Work Location:** Is this role fully on-site in Abu Dhabi, or is there a hybrid work model?
15. **Interview Process:** What are the steps in the interview process? (e.g., 1. Recruiter Screen, 2. Hiring Manager Interview, 3. Panel/Stakeholder Interview, 4. Final with Director). This helps the recruiter manage candidate expectations.

Once you provide these answers, I will synthesize them with the job description to create the perfect, easy-to-understand brief for your non-technical recruiter. I will wait for your input.

### **Recruitment Brief: Head of Applications Service Management**

**(Version 1.0 - Created: [Date])**

**Prepared for: [Recruiter's Name/Agency]**
**Prepared by: [Your Name/Company]**

Hi [Recruiter's Name],

Thank you for partnering with us on this critical search. This document is your comprehensive guide to finding the perfect **Head of Applications Service Management**. Please read it carefully, as it goes beyond the formal job description to give you the context, priorities, and "insider view" you need to identify and attract top talent.

Our goal is to find a leader, not just a manager. This person will be the guardian of our most critical business systems.

### **1. The Elevator Pitch: What's the Story?**

**Think of our company as the central nervous system for key government functions in Abu Dhabi. Our core software, the "ADERP" system, is the digital backbone that allows everything to run smoothly.**

We are looking for a senior leader to take complete ownership of keeping this backbone strong, stable, and reliable. This isn't just an IT support role; it's about ensuring the continuity of essential services. The person in this role will lead the "first responder" team that fixes issues, but more importantly, they will build the strategy to prevent those issues from happening in the first place. They will be a diplomat, a strategist, and a team builder, all in one.

### **2. The Role Explained in Simple Terms**

Forget the jargon for a moment. Here’s what this person will actually be doing:

*   **Be the "Fire Chief":** When a major system issue happens (an "incident"), they are in charge. They don't have to hold the hose themselves, but they direct the team, communicate clearly to leadership what's happening, and ensure the fire is put out quickly and effectively.
*   **Be the "Doctor":** After a problem is solved, they lead the "post-mortem." They need to be obsessed with answering "Why did this happen?" and implementing permanent fixes to prevent it from happening again (this is "Problem Management").
*   **Be the "Coach":** They will lead a team of technical specialists. Their job is to mentor, develop, and motivate this team, turning them into a high-performing unit that the business trusts completely.
*   **Be the "Diplomat":** They will be the main point of contact for senior leaders across different government entities. They need to be able to translate complex technical issues into simple business language, manage expectations, and build strong, trusting relationships.
*   **Be the "Rule-Maker":** They will use a proven playbook (called "ITIL") to bring structure and professionalism to how we manage our IT services. This means creating clear processes for handling requests, fixing problems, and measuring success.

### **3. Decoding the Terminology (Your Cheat Sheet)**

Use this to understand the key terms and ask intelligent questions.

*   **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning):** This is the most important piece of software in a large organization. Think of it as the company's brain and central database. It manages everything from finance and HR to procurement and operations.
*   **ADERP (Abu Dhabi ERP):** This is our specific ERP system. It's based on **[Insert technology from your answer, e.g., SAP S/4HANA]** and is the system this person will be primarily responsible for.
*   **Tier 1 ERP (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft):** These are the "big three" global leaders in ERP software. A candidate MUST have experience with at least one of these, as the principles of managing them are similar. Our preference is **[Insert preference from your answer]**.
*   **ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library):** This is simply a set of best-practice guidelines for running IT services. Think of it as the "handbook for professional IT management." It covers everything from Incident Management to Service Improvement. Experience with this shows a candidate is disciplined and process-oriented.
*   **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** This is a promise. It's a formal agreement on the level of service we will provide to the business. For example, "We promise to resolve 95% of critical issues within 4 hours." This role is about defining and meeting these promises.
*   **Stakeholder:** Anyone who has an interest in or is affected by the IT systems. In our case, these are very senior people in government, so communication and relationship skills are paramount.

### **4. The Ideal Candidate Profile: Who Are We Looking For?**

This is the most important section. We are looking for a specific blend of experience and personality.

**Must-Have Experience & Skills (Deal-Breakers):**

1.  **ERP Service Leadership:** At least 5+ years leading a team that *supports* a major Tier 1 ERP system (SAP, Oracle, etc.). **Crucially, their experience must be in support and service management, NOT just project implementation.**
2.  **Proven Team Leadership:** They must have a track record of managing, mentoring, and developing a team of at least **[Insert team size from your answer]** technical staff.
3.  **Crisis Management:** They must be able to tell you a compelling story about a time they managed a major system outage, how they communicated with stakeholders, and how they resolved it. They must be calm and decisive under extreme pressure.
4.  **Process-Driven Mindset:** They must demonstrate deep, practical experience using the ITIL framework to run a support function, even if they don't have the certification. They should be able to talk fluently about incident, problem, and change management.
5.  **Stakeholder Management:** They must have experience working with senior, non-technical business leaders. Experience with **[Specify government or large corporate context from your answer]** is a huge plus and strongly preferred.

**Key Personality Traits (The "Fit"):**

*   **Ownership Mentality:** They see a problem and own it until it's resolved. They don't blame others.
*   **Exceptional Communicator:** Can explain a complex server failure to a government minister in a way that is clear, calm, and inspires confidence.
*   **Proactive, Not Reactive:** Doesn't wait for things to break. They are always looking at data, trends, and user feedback to anticipate and prevent future problems.
*   **A Natural Diplomat:** They are skilled at building consensus, managing difficult personalities, and negotiating with vendors and internal teams. They are politically savvy.
*   **Resilient & Patient:** They understand that change in a large, complex environment takes time and persistence.

### **5. Key Screening Questions for You to Ask**

1.  "Tell me about the largest and most complex ERP environment you have been responsible for supporting. What was the technology and what was the size of the user base?"
2.  "Walk me through a time you handled a major, business-critical system failure. What was your specific role, how did you manage your team, and how did you communicate with business leaders?" (Listen for calmness, clear process, and ownership).
3.  "Describe your experience implementing or improving an ITIL-based service model. What were the biggest challenges, and what was the result?" (Listen for practical application, not just textbook definitions).
4.  "How do you measure the success of an application support team? Tell me about the KPIs and SLAs you have used in the past."
5.  "This role requires building relationships with senior government officials. Describe a situation where you had to explain a negative technical update (like a delay or an outage) to a very senior, non-technical stakeholder."

### **6. Red Flags: What to Watch Out For**

*   **Project Managers:** Candidates whose experience is purely in implementing new systems or managing projects. We need someone who has lived in the world of day-to-day support and operations.
*   **Pure Technologists:** Someone who clearly prefers to be "hands-on" with the technology and is uncomfortable with leadership, strategy, and stakeholder management.
*   **Blame-Oriented Language:** Candidates who describe past failures by blaming other teams, vendors, or users. We need someone who takes accountability.
*   **Vague on Process:** If they can't clearly explain the difference between an "incident" and a "problem," they likely lack the process discipline we need.
