Excellent. This is exactly the right approach. A great brief is more important than a great job description. A JD tells you *what* the job is; a brief tells you *who* to find and *why* they would want it.

Before I create the final brief, I need to be your strategic partner. I will now ask you a series of questions. Your answers will allow me to translate the corporate language of the JD into a clear, compelling, and actionable document for your external recruiter.

Please answer the following questions as thoroughly as you can.

### **Questions to Build Your Recruiter Brief**

**Part 1: The Big Picture & The "Why"**

1.  **Reason for the Opening:** Is this a brand-new position, or is it a backfill for someone who left?
    *   If it's a backfill, why did the previous person leave? What did they do well, and where were the gaps we're hoping to fill?
    *   If it's a new role, what business pain or growth opportunity prompted its creation?

2.  **The #1 Priority:** If this new HRBP could only accomplish *one thing* in their first year, what would be the most critical business problem they would solve for the Engineering and Product teams? (e.g., "Reduce attrition of senior engineers by 10%," "Help the VPs restructure their teams for a new product launch," "Improve manager effectiveness.")

3.  **Success in 12 Months:** Paint a picture for me. It's one year from now, and you're thinking, "Wow, hiring this person was the best decision we made." What did they accomplish? What does the team or organization look like now that they're here?

**Part 2: The People & The Culture**

4.  **The Hiring Manager:** Who does this role report to? What is their title (e.g., HR Director, VP of HR)? What is their leadership style? What do they value most in an HRBP? (e.g., data, speed, strong relationships, challenging the status quo).

5.  **The Stakeholders:** The JD mentions the VP of Engineering and VP of Product.
    *   Can you describe their personalities and working styles? Are they data-driven, fast-moving, skeptical of HR, collaborative?
    *   What are their biggest business challenges right now? (e.g., hiring enough talent, retaining key people, launching a new product, integrating a new team). This is what the HRBP will be helping them with.

6.  **The HR Team:** What is the structure of the broader HR team? Is this HRBP a lone wolf, or are they part of a team of other BPs? Are there centralized teams (Centers of Excellence) for things like Compensation, Recruiting, and Learning & Development that they will partner with?

7.  **The Real Culture:** The JD says "Best Place to Work." Let's get specific. On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = slow and bureaucratic, 10 = chaotic and lightning-fast), what is the pace of the company? What are three words you would use to describe the *actual* day-to-day work environment?

**Part 3: Decoding the Role & Responsibilities**

8.  **Strategic vs. Tactical:** On an average week, what percentage of this role will be high-level strategy (like org design, succession planning) versus hands-on tactical work (like handling employee relations issues, answering manager questions)?

9.  **"Complex Employee Relations":** Can you give a non-confidential, hypothetical example of what "complex" means here? Are we talking about performance issues with a senior leader, team-wide conflict, or something else? This helps the recruiter understand the level of seniority required.

10. **Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves:** Let's prioritize the "Required Qualifications."
    *   How critical is experience supporting a **technology/engineering** organization? Could someone from a complex, fast-paced industry like finance or consulting succeed if they are a quick learner?
    *   The JD says 7+ years of experience. Is that a firm rule? What if a perfect-fit candidate has 6 amazing years of experience?
    *   How important is **Workday** experience? Is it a dealbreaker or a "nice-to-have"?

**Part 4: The Sourcing & Screening Process**

11. **Ideal Candidate Persona:** Beyond the resume, what kind of person thrives in this role and at GlobalTech? Are they an empathetic coach, a data-driven analyst, a resilient change agent?

12. **Red Flags:** What are some immediate deal-breakers you'd want the recruiter to screen out? (e.g., "Someone who has only ever worked in very slow, traditional companies," "Candidates who describe their work as purely administrative," "Job hoppers.")

13. **Interview Process:** What are the steps in the interview process? Who will the candidate meet at each stage? This helps the recruiter prepare candidates and manage expectations.

Once you provide these answers, I will synthesize them with the JD to create the comprehensive brief. Assuming you've provided the answers, here is the brief I would create.

### **Recruiter Brief: HR Business Partner, Engineering & Product**

**CONFIDENTIAL**

**To:** External Recruitment Partner
**From:** [Your Name/Hiring Manager Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Subject:** Kick-off Brief for a Strategic HR Business Partner Search

Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thank you for partnering with us on this critical search. This document is your comprehensive guide to finding an exceptional HR Business Partner for our Engineering and Product organizations. Please read this carefully, as it goes beyond the formal job description to give you the context, nuance, and "real story" you'll need to identify and attract top talent.

Our goal is to find a true partner, not just a resume that matches keywords.

### **Part 1: The "Why" - Understanding the Big Picture**

**The Elevator Pitch (Your 30-second summary for candidates):**

"GlobalTech Solutions is looking for a strategic HR Business Partner to act as a trusted advisor to the leadership of our two most critical teams: Engineering and Product. This isn't a typical HR role; you'll be a core member of the leadership team, shaping strategy for an 800-person global organization that is the engine of our company's growth. You'll be solving complex challenges around team design, talent development, and scaling our culture as we continue to grow rapidly."

**Why is this Role Open?**

This is a newly created position due to our significant growth. Our Engineering and Product organizations have scaled to a point (800 employees) where they require a dedicated, senior-level HR partner. The VPs of these departments need a strategic thought partner to help them proactively design their organizations for the future, rather than just reactively solving people's problems.

**What Success Looks Like (The First-Year Scorecard):**

In the first 12 months, the successful candidate will have:
*   **Built Unshakable Trust:** Become the go-to advisor for the VP of Engineering and VP of Product. They are included in senior leadership meetings not as an HR note-taker, but as a valued voice on business strategy.
*   **Solved a Key Talent Problem:** Made a measurable impact on a key business challenge, such as improving our ability to retain top engineering talent or designing a career pathing framework that keeps our product managers engaged.
*   **Led a Major Organizational Change:** Successfully guided a department through a significant change, like a team restructure or the integration of a new group, ensuring a smooth transition with high employee morale.
*   **Made Us Smarter with Data:** Used data (from engagement surveys, exit interviews, etc.) to present insights that led to a tangible change in how we manage our people.

### **Part 2: The Company, People & Culture**

**About GlobalTech Solutions (In Simple Terms):**

Forget the corporate jargon. We make software that helps big companies (think retailers, car manufacturers) manage their products all the way from the factory floor to the store shelf or customer's doorstep. It's a complex, global puzzle, and our software is the brain that makes it all work. We are a "business-to-business" (B2B) software company.

**The Stakeholders You'll Partner With:**

*   **VP of Engineering:** Highly analytical, brilliant, and data-driven. They respect people who come with evidence and a clear, logical plan. They are focused on attracting and retaining the best software engineers in the world to stay ahead of the competition.
*   **VP of Product:** Creative, fast-paced, and customer-obsessed. They are focused on innovation and speed. They need a partner who can help them build agile, high-performing teams that can pivot quickly.
*   **Your Manager (HR Director):** [Describe the hiring manager's style, e.g., "A collaborative leader who believes in giving their BPs autonomy. They value proactive communication and are looking for someone to be a true partner, not just an employee. They will be your biggest advocate and support system."]

**Our Culture: The Real Story**

The "Best Place to Work" award is nice, but here's the reality:
*   **Pace:** We are an 8 out of 10 on the speed scale. We are fast-paced and driven, but not chaotic. We value thoughtful planning before execution.
*   **Three-Word Summary:** **Data-Driven, Ambitious, Collaborative.**
*   **What this means:** Decisions are made with data, not just gut feelings. People here are smart, driven, and want to win. You won't find big egos; people are expected to roll up their sleeves and work together to solve problems.

### **Part 3: Decoding the Role & Technical Terms**

This role is roughly **60% Strategic Partnership & Coaching** and **40% Tactical/Operational Execution** (like employee relations, program roll-outs).

**Let's Translate Some HR Jargon:**

*   **HR Business Partner (HRBP):** Think of this as an HR consultant embedded within a specific business unit (in this case, Engineering & Product). They report to central HR but dedicate 100% of their time to that business unit.
*   **Organizational Design & Workforce Planning:** This simply means figuring out the best way to structure teams to meet business goals. Questions they'd help answer: "Do we have the right number of managers?" "Should we combine these two teams?" "What skills will we need to hire for next year?"
*   **Calibration Sessions:** This is a meeting where managers discuss their employees' performance to ensure fairness. The HRBP facilitates this to make sure a "high performer" in one team is judged by the same standards as a high performer in another.
*   **RSU (Restricted Stock Unit):** A promise from the company to give an employee shares of stock in the future. It's a key part of long-term compensation in the tech industry and helps employees feel like owners.

### **Part 4: The Ideal Candidate Profile**

**Must-Have DNA (Non-Negotiables):**

1.  **Experience Supporting Tech/Engineering Teams:** This is critical. We need someone who understands the mindset of engineers and product managers. They know what motivates them, what frustrates them, and how to earn their respect. They "speak the language."
2.  **Proven Strategic Chops:** Look for evidence of them leading projects like org design, succession planning, or developing a talent strategy. They must have moved beyond just reacting to HR issues.
3.  **Gravitas & Influence:** They must be able to confidently advise and, when necessary, challenge senior executives. They can't be intimidated by strong personalities. Ask them for a time they had to influence a senior leader who disagreed with them.
4.  **High Emotional Intelligence (EQ):** They will handle sensitive situations (layoffs, performance issues, conflicts). They must be empathetic, discreet, and professional.

**Key Experience to Screen For:**

*   Look for resumes that mention supporting a client group of **at least 500+ people** in a tech environment.
*   Prioritize candidates from other **enterprise software (B2B)** or well-respected **high-growth tech companies** (e.g., Salesforce, Adobe, ServiceNow, Atlassian, or rapidly scaling pre-IPO companies).
*   Their experience should clearly show a progression from a generalist/operational role to a strategic HRBP role.

**Red Flags (What to Avoid):**

*   **Purely Administrative HR Background:** If their experience is only in payroll, benefits administration, or HR coordination, they are not a fit.
*   **"Process Police":** We need someone who can be flexible and business-focused, not someone who rigidly enforces HR rules without understanding the business context.
*   **Needs Lots of Direction:** The ideal candidate is a proactive self-starter who can identify problems and propose solutions without being told what to do.
