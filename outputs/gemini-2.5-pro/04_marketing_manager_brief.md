Of course. This is an excellent approach. A great brief is the foundation of a successful search. Before I write the full brief, I need to get inside your head and understand the nuances that aren't on the page.

As your recruitment consultant, here are the questions I would ask to get the critical information needed to create a world-class brief for your external recruiter. Please think through these and provide me with your answers. The more detail, the better!

### **Questions to Build the Recruiter Brief**

**Part 1: The Big Picture & Company Context**

1.  **Company Story:** The JD says you're a "$50M company that grew from a startup." Can you give me the 2-minute "origin story"? What was the founder's vision? What makes GreenLeaf Organics special beyond just selling organic food?
2.  **Mission & Vibe:** What is the company's core mission? Is it about sustainability, health, accessibility of organic food? What are three words you would use to describe the office culture and work environment? (e.g., collaborative, fast-paced, mission-driven, casual, intense?)
3.  **The "Why Now?":** Why is this role open? Is it a new position, or are you backfilling someone? What specific business problem or opportunity has led to the creation/opening of this Senior Marketing Manager role right now? (e.g., "We've hit a plateau and need fresh ideas," or "We're launching a huge new product line and need a leader to drive it.")

**Part 2: The Role & Team Dynamics**

4.  **Reporting Structure:** Who will this person report to? What is that person's title and background? What is their leadership style like (e.g., hands-on, delegator, data-driven)?
5.  **Team Details:** The JD mentions a team of 4. What are their roles and experience levels? Is the team running smoothly, or does it need a leader to provide structure and direction? What is the team dynamic like?
6.  **Success in the First Year:** Fast forward 12 months. The person you hired is a superstar. What exactly did they accomplish? Be specific. (e.g., "They successfully launched our new snack line, grew our TikTok following by 200%, and lowered our customer acquisition cost by 15%.")
7.  **Biggest Challenge:** What is the single biggest challenge this person will face in their first six months? (e.g., "Getting our retail partners excited," "proving the ROI of their new ideas," "managing a junior team with big personalities.")

**Part 3: The Ideal Candidate (Beyond the Resume)**

8.  **Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves:** Let's get really specific.
    *   Is **CPG/FMCG industry experience** a 100% non-negotiable deal-breaker? Could someone from a direct-to-consumer (DTC) apparel brand with amazing digital skills succeed?
    *   How firm are you on **7+ years of experience**? Would you consider a 5-year "rockstar" who has done everything in the JD?
    *   What is more important: managing a **large budget ($2M+)** or managing **people (3+ years)**? If you had to choose one, which would it be?
9.  **Target Companies:** What companies are you inspired by? Where would your ideal candidate be working right now? (e.g., "Someone from Annie's Homegrown, Clif Bar, or maybe a cool, up-and-coming brand like LesserEvil or Hu Kitchen.") This helps the recruiter know where to look.
10. **Soft Skills:** What personality traits are crucial for success in this role and at your company? (e.g., scrappy, resilient, highly collaborative, a creative problem-solver, not afraid to get their hands dirty).
11. **Red Flags:** What kind of profile should the recruiter *avoid*? (e.g., "Someone who has only worked at huge, slow-moving corporations with unlimited budgets," or "Someone who is purely a 'strategist' and doesn't want to execute.")

**Part 4: Logistics & Selling Points**

12. **The Pitch:** Besides the salary and benefits, what are the top 3 reasons someone should be excited to leave their current job for this one? (e.g., "The chance to build a brand," "direct impact on company growth," "a mission you can believe in," "equity in a high-growth company.")
13. **Interview Process:** What are the specific steps in the interview process? Who will be involved at each stage? (e.g., Step 1: Recruiter screen, Step 2: Call with me (Hiring Manager), Step 3: Case study/presentation, Step 4: Final interviews with CEO and Head of Sales).
14. **Flexibility:** The JD says "Hybrid - 3 days in office." How flexible is this? Are the days set, or can the candidate choose?

Once you provide answers to these questions, I will transform them into the perfect, easy-to-understand brief.

**(Please proceed by providing your answers as if you were the hiring manager. I will then use your input to write the final brief.)**

### **Recruiter Brief: Senior Marketing Manager for GreenLeaf Organics**

**CONFIDENTIAL**

**Prepared for:** [Recruiter's Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Role:** Senior Marketing Manager
**Location:** Denver, CO (Hybrid)

#### **1. The Elevator Pitch: What’s the Story?**

Hi [Recruiter's Name],

We're looking for a marketing leader for GreenLeaf Organics, a company that's making healthy, organic food accessible to everyone. We've had incredible success, growing from a small farmers' market stand to a $50 million brand in just five years.

Now, we're at a key moment. We need to go from being a "successful startup" to a "household name." This Senior Marketing Manager is the person who will help us do that. They won't just be running ads; they'll be telling our story, building a loyal community of fans, and leading a team to make a real impact. This is a role for someone who wants to build something meaningful, not just manage a spreadsheet.

#### **2. About Us: The GreenLeaf Organics Story (In Simple Terms)**

*   **Who We Are:** We are GreenLeaf Organics. We sell organic and sustainable food products—things you'd find in the grocery store aisle like snacks, sauces, and grains.
*   **Our Mission:** Our founder started this company because he believed that eating healthy and organic shouldn't be a luxury. Our mission is to make good food, grown the right way, available to as many people as possible. We care deeply about sustainability and our impact on the planet.
*   **Our Vibe:** We're **fast-paced, collaborative, and mission-driven**. Think of us as a high-energy startup but with the stability of a successful business. We work hard, but we're all here because we believe in what we're doing. It’s a very "roll-up-your-sleeves" and "all-hands-on-deck" environment.

#### **3. The Role: Why We Need This Person & What They'll Do**

**The Big Picture:** We've grown mainly through word-of-mouth and having great products. To reach our next goal of $100M, we need a formal marketing strategy. This role is brand new and created to be the "engine" of our marketing. They are here to take our scrappy marketing efforts and turn them into a professional, high-return operation.

**Their Main Goal:** Increase **brand awareness** (how many people know who we are) and drive sales by finding new customers.

**Key Responsibilities (Explained in Plain English):**

*   **Be the Marketing Mastermind:** They will create the overall plan for how we market our products. This means deciding where we spend our money to get the best results.
*   **Manage the Money ($2M+ Budget):** They'll be in charge of a large budget. A key part of their job is tracking if the money we spend on ads is actually leading to sales. We need someone who is comfortable with numbers and can prove their work is paying off.
*   **Lead the Team:** They will manage a team of four junior marketers. They need to be a great coach who can help the team grow, give clear direction, and keep everyone motivated.
*   **Launch New Products:** We launch over 10 new products a year. They will work with our food development team to create the marketing buzz for each launch, from social media campaigns to in-store displays.
*   **Be the "Brand Guardian":** They will create the "rulebook" for our brand's look and feel (logos, colors, voice) to ensure we look and sound consistent everywhere.
*   **Manage Our Partners:** They will be the main point of contact for our external partners, like the ad agency that buys our digital ads and the PR firm that gets us in magazines.
*   **Own Social Media & Influencers:** They will be in charge of our presence on Instagram, TikTok, etc. This includes finding and managing relationships with "influencers" (popular social media personalities) who can promote our products.

#### **4. The Ideal Candidate Profile: Who Are We Looking For?**

This is the most important part. We need someone who fits both the experience and the culture.

**MUST-HAVE Experience (Deal-Breakers):**

1.  **CPG/FMCG Industry Experience (Minimum 3 years):** This is non-negotiable. They MUST understand the world of selling physical products in grocery stores. They need to know how this industry works. Look for people from food, beverage, or similar consumer goods companies.
2.  **People Management (Minimum 3 years):** They must have experience as a direct manager. We need a leader, not just a senior individual contributor. Ask them about their management style.
3.  **Proven Campaign Success:** They need to be able to walk you through a marketing campaign they built from scratch and show you the results (e.g., "I launched X product, and we saw a 30% increase in sales in the first quarter").
4.  **Budget Management ($1M+):** They must have experience managing a seven-figure marketing budget.

**IDEAL Background & Skills (The "Perfect" Candidate):**

*   **Company Archetype:** The dream candidate comes from a brand we admire, like **Annie's Homegrown, Clif Bar, Kind Snacks, or maybe a fast-growing, cool brand like Hu Kitchen or LesserEvil.** They could also come from the organic division of a larger company like General Mills or Danone, as long as they still have a "scrappy" mindset.
*   **Digital Savvy:** They are very comfortable with digital marketing, especially paid social ads (Facebook/Instagram) and analyzing data with tools like Google Analytics.
*   **Balanced Brain:** They are both creative (can come up with great campaign ideas) and analytical (can dive into the data to see what's working).

**Personality & Soft Skills (Crucial for Culture Fit):**

*   **A Builder, Not a Maintainer:** They should be excited by the idea of creating a marketing function, not just running a pre-existing one.
*   **Scrappy & Resilient:** They need to be a creative problem-solver who can make a big impact with a budget that is smaller than at a giant corporation.
*   **No Ego / Hands-On:** They must be willing to "get their hands dirty." We're not a company where managers just delegate. They'll be writing copy one day and presenting to the CEO the next.
*   **Collaborative:** They will be working with nearly every team in the company. They need to be a great partner, especially to the Sales and Product teams.

**RED FLAGS (Who to Avoid):**

*   **The "Big Corp" Marketer:** Be cautious of candidates who have only ever worked at massive companies (e.g., Procter & Gamble, Unilever) with unlimited budgets and huge teams. They may struggle in our faster, more resource-constrained environment.
*   **The "Pure Strategist":** Avoid people who talk only in high-level theory and seem hesitant to be involved in the actual execution of the campaigns.
*   **Job Hoppers:** Someone who has had 4 jobs in 5 years might not be the right fit for a role that requires building something long-term.

#### **5. The Pitch: Why This is a Great Opportunity**

Here are the key selling points you should use to get candidates excited:

1.  **Build Your Legacy:** This isn't a cog-in-a-wheel job. They will be building our marketing department from the ground up. Their work will have a direct and visible impact on the company's success.
2.  **Equity & Ownership:** They get a competitive salary, a bonus, AND equity. They will have a real stake in the company they are helping to build.
3.  **A Mission That Matters:** We're not just selling widgets. We have a powerful mission to improve people's health and the planet's health. This is a job they can feel proud of.
4.  **Growth & Autonomy:** We are growing fast, which means opportunities for career growth. We trust our leaders, and this person will have the autonomy to bring their vision to life.

#### **6. Logistics**

*   **Salary Range:** $120,000 - $150,000 base
*   **Bonus:** Up to 20% performance-based bonus
*   **Other Comp:** Equity participation
*   **Location:** Denver, CO. Hybrid, with 3 days per week in our office. The specific days are flexible.
*   **Interview Process:**
    1.  **You:** Initial screen (30 mins)
    2.  **Hiring Manager (Me):** Deeper dive into experience and skills (45-60 mins)
    3.  **Case Study:** We will give them a short business problem to solve and present back to a small panel. This helps us see how they think. (1-hour presentation)
    4.  **Final Round:** Meet with our CEO and the Head of Sales (2 x 30-min chats)

Please let me know if you have any questions. Let's start by targeting candidates with the **Must-Have CPG experience** and the **people management** background first. I'm excited to see who you find
