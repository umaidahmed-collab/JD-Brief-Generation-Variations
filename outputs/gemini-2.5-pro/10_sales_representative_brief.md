Of course. This is an excellent approach. A great brief is the foundation of a successful search. Before I can write the comprehensive brief for your recruiter, I need to understand the nuances that aren't in the job description.

Please answer the following questions. The more detail you provide, the better I can equip your recruiter to act as a true extension of your team.

***

### **My Questions For You:**

**Part 1: The "Why" - Understanding the Big Picture**

1.  **Reason for the Hire:** Is this a brand-new position due to growth, or are you replacing someone who left? (If it's a replacement, what made the previous person successful or unsuccessful?)
2.  **Urgency:** On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is this hire? What is your ideal start date?
3.  **Impact:** What is the single biggest business problem this person will solve in their first 6-12 months? (e.g., "Crack into the top 10 financial institutions on the West Coast," "Prove our new product's value in the retail sector.")

**Part 2: The Ideal Candidate - Beyond the Resume**

4.  **Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves:** Let's get specific. If you had to choose only THREE "must-have" qualifications from your list, what are they? Conversely, which qualifications are you flexible on for an otherwise stellar candidate?
5.  **The "CISO" Experience:** The JD says "experience selling to CISO/security organizations strongly preferred." Is this a deal-breaker? Could a fantastic enterprise software salesperson who has only sold to CIOs or VPs of Infrastructure be successful? Why or why not?
6.  **Deal Size History:** You mention a track record of closing $500k+ ACV deals. Is this a hard rule? What if a candidate has consistently closed $250k-$400k deals in a highly competitive space and shows massive potential?
7.  **"Hunter" Profile:** Can you describe what a "hunter mentality" looks like in practice? Are you looking for someone who built a territory from scratch, or someone who is adept at finding new divisions within existing logos?
8.  **Red Flags:** What are the immediate red flags or deal-breakers you'd want the recruiter to screen out? (e.g., too many jobs in a short time, focuses only on price, can't explain *how* they closed a deal).

**Part 3: The Company, Team & Culture**

9.  **The Hiring Manager:** Who does this role report to? What is their leadership style? What do they value most in their team members?
10. **Team Structure:** How large is the current Enterprise Sales team? How is it structured (e.g., by region, by industry)? How many other reps will this person work alongside in the Western US territory?
11. **The Support System:** The JD mentions BDRs, Sales Engineers, and Marketing. Can you explain how this relationship works in practice? Will this rep get a dedicated BDR? How are leads generated and distributed?
12. **Company Culture:** "High-growth" can mean many things. Describe the sales culture in three words. Is it more "move fast and break things" or "measure twice, cut once"? Is it highly collaborative or more individual ("eat what you kill")?

**Part 4: The Nitty-Gritty of the Role**

13. **Competitors:** Who are your top 2-3 direct competitors? Knowing this helps the recruiter identify candidates with relevant experience (and potentially source from them).
14. **The Product:** On a scale of 1-10, how technical does this person need to be? Can they rely heavily on a Sales Engineer, or do they need to be able to hold their own in a technical discussion?
15. **The Territory:** You've listed the Western US. Is there an existing book of business or warm leads, or is this a "greenfield" territory they will be building from the ground up?

**Part cinqu: The Recruitment Process**

16. **Interview Stages:** Please outline the step-by-step interview process from the recruiter's submission to the final offer. Who will be involved at each stage? (e.g., 1. Recruiter Screen, 2. Hiring Manager, 3. Panel with SE and peer, 4. VP of Sales, 5. Offer).
17. **Key Selling Points:** Besides the compensation, what are the top 3 reasons someone should leave a stable job at a larger competitor to join CloudSecure? (e.g., "ground-floor opportunity," "disruptive technology," "career velocity").

Once you provide these answers, I will synthesize them with the job description into a perfect, easy-to-understand brief for your external recruiter.

### **Recruiter Brief: Enterprise Sales Representative (Western US)**

**Prepared For:** [Recruiter's Name/Agency]
**Date:** [Date]
**Priority Level:** High

---

### **1. The Elevator Pitch: Your 30-Second Summary for Candidates**

"I'm representing CloudSecure, a cybersecurity company that's growing at over 100% year-over-year and is backed by top-tier investors. Think of them as a digital Fort Knox for the world's biggest companies. They are looking for a top-performing enterprise salesperson to own the Western US territory, selling their security platform to the largest companies in the world (the Fortune 1000). This is a remote 'hunter' role where you'll be building your own franchise, closing six and seven-figure deals, and have a direct path to earning over $350k with uncapped commissions and meaningful pre-IPO equity."

### **2. About Us & What We Actually Do (In Simple Terms)**

*   **What We Do:** Companies are moving all their data and applications to the cloud (like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud). This is like moving from a house with a simple lock to a massive, complex skyscraper. Our software acts as the advanced security system for that entire skyscraper. We help companies see who is coming and going, detect threats before they happen, and protect their most valuable digital assets.
*   **Our Customers:** We protect over 500 major companies globally. Think big banks, healthcare systems, and major retailers.
*   **Why We're Winning:** We are growing incredibly fast (100%+ year-over-year) because our technology is newer and smarter than the older solutions on the market. We've raised $150M, which gives us the stability and resources to compete and win against the big, slow-moving players.

### **3. The Role Explained: What This Person Will *Really* Be Doing**

This isn't an "account manager" role. This person is a **hunter**. Their main job is to find and win **new customers**.

*   **Their Goal:** To find large companies (with over 5,000 employees) in the Western US and convince them to use CloudSecure to protect their cloud environments.
*   **Their Target:** They will be selling to the highest levels of an organization, specifically the **CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)**. This is the executive in charge of a company's entire security strategy.
*   **The Sales Process:** These are not quick, simple sales. They are complex and can take 6-12 months. The salesperson acts like a **quarterback**, coordinating with many different people at the customer's company (security experts, IT teams, finance, and executives) to get the deal done.
*   **A Typical Week Might Look Like:**
    *   Prospecting for new companies and contacts.
    *   Holding initial "discovery" calls to understand a company's security pains.
    *   Working with a Sales Engineer (our technical expert) to give product demonstrations.
    *   Building a business case to show the customer how we save them money and reduce risk.
    *   Negotiating contracts and closing deals.

### **4. The Ideal Candidate Profile: Who to Find**

We need an elite salesperson. Think of them as the "Special Forces" of enterprise software sales.

**🎯 Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable):**

1.  **Proven Enterprise Hunter:** 5-7+ years of experience, with at least 3+ years selling complex software/technology solutions to large enterprise accounts. They must have a "hunter" DNA and a clear history of acquiring *new logos* (new customers).
2.  **Big Deal Experience:** They must have a proven, repeatable track record of closing deals with an **Annual Contract Value (ACV)** of at least $200k, and ideally have experience with deals over $500k. Ask them to walk you through their biggest deal and their role in it.
3.  **Quota Crusher:** They must have a history of consistently meeting or exceeding their sales quota (at least 2 of the last 3 years). We are looking for top 10% performers.

**👍 Nice-to-Haves (Highly Valued):**

*   **Cybersecurity Experience:** The absolute best candidates will have sold to CISOs before. They'll understand the security world and its challenges. Candidates from competitors like **Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, or Zscaler** are a fantastic fit.
*   **C-Level Presence:** They must be polished, confident, and credible when speaking with executives.
*   **Startup DNA:** They thrive in a fast-paced, high-growth environment where they have to be resourceful and self-motivated.
*   **Formal Sales Training:** Experience with sales methodologies like **MEDDIC** is a huge plus, as it shows they have a structured approach to complex sales.

**❌ Red Flags & Who to Avoid:**

*   **The Account Manager:** Someone whose experience is primarily farming existing accounts for renewals and small upsells.
*   **The Job Hopper:** Candidates with more than 3 jobs in the last 5 years (unless there's a very good reason, like an acquisition).
*   **The "Blamer":** Someone who blames their territory, their company, or the economy for not hitting their quota. We want people who take ownership.
*   **Small Deal Sellers:** Candidates who have only sold products with a value of $50k or less. The skill set for closing $500k deals is completely different.

### **5. Key Terms Explained (Your Cheat Sheet)**

*   **ACV (Annual Contract Value):** The amount of money the customer agrees to pay for our service over a 12-month period. This is our key metric for new sales.
*   **CISO (Chief Information Security Officer):** The top security executive at a company. Our key buyer.
*   **POC (Proof of Concept):** A trial period where we let a potential customer test our product in their own environment to prove it works as advertised. This is a critical step in our sales process.
*   **Sales Engineer (SE):** The technical expert on the sales team. The SE partners with the salesperson to handle deep technical questions and run product demonstrations.
*   **MEDDIC:** A popular sales methodology for complex sales. It stands for Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, and Champion. Don't worry about the details, but if a candidate mentions it, that's a great sign.
*   **Hunter:** A salesperson focused 100% on acquiring *new* customers, not managing existing ones.

### **6. The Team, Culture & Leadership**

*   **Hiring Manager:** [Insert Hiring Manager's Name & Title]. Their style is [e.g., "very hands-on and loves to strategize on deals," "empowering and trusts their reps to run their territory," "data-driven and expects reps to know their numbers cold"].
*   **Team:** This role is part of the [e.g., "10-person North American Enterprise Sales team"]. They will be one of [e.g., "three"] reps covering the West.
*   **Culture:** The sales floor is energetic, competitive, and collaborative. People celebrate wins together, but everyone is held accountable for their numbers. It's a "work hard, play hard" environment with a huge emphasis on winning.

### **7. Selling the Opportunity: Why Join Us?**

1.  **Massive Earning Potential:** With a $280k-$350k OTE, uncapped commissions, and accelerators for over-performance, a top rep can realistically earn over $500k.
2.  **Wealth-Building Equity:** We are a pre-IPO company on a fast-track. The stock options offered are meaningful and could be life-changing upon a future IPO or acquisition.
3.  **Career Velocity:** The company is growing fast. Someone who succeeds in this role will have opportunities to move into leadership or other strategic roles far faster than they would at a larger, more established company.
4.  **A Product That Wins:** We are selling a market-leading technology that solves a real, urgent problem for customers. You are not selling a "me-too" product.

### **8. The Interview Process**

1.  **Recruiter Screen:** Your initial call to vet against the "Must-Haves."
2.  **Call with Hiring Manager:** Focus on sales metrics, deal experience, and cultural fit.
3.  **Panel Interview:** Meet with a top Sales Engineer and a peer Enterprise Rep. This will test their ability to collaborate and their technical aptitude.
4em> **Presentation Stage:** The candidate will be asked to present a strategic plan for their territory or a mock account.
5.  **Final Interview:** Conversation with the VP of Sales.
6.  **Offer:** We move quickly for the right candidates. Target timeline is 3-4 weeks from first interview to offer.
