Excellent. This is the perfect approach. To create the most effective and comprehensive brief for your external recruiter, I need to understand the nuances that aren't captured in the formal job description. Think of me as your recruitment partner; the more context you give me, the better I can equip your recruiter to find the perfect candidate.

Please answer the following questions as thoroughly as you can. I've grouped them to make it easier.

---

### **Part 1: Understanding the "Why" and the Team**

1.  **Reason for the Opening:** Why is this position available? Is it due to team expansion, someone being promoted, someone leaving, or something else? (This helps the recruiter frame the opportunity positively).
2.  **The Team Dynamic:**
    *   Tell me about the team they'll be joining. How many nurses are on a typical shift? What is the general age range and experience level?
    *   What is the team culture like? Is it collaborative, "like a family," very direct and professional, fast-paced and high-energy? Is there a lot of humor, or is it more serious?
    *   Who is the direct manager (the Nurse Manager/Director of the ED)? What is their leadership style? Are they very hands-on, a mentor, focused on metrics, a strong advocate for their staff?
3.  **A Day in the Life:**
    *   Beyond the JD, what does a typical 12-hour shift *really* look like? What are the biggest challenges of the role (e.g., high patient volume, specific types of difficult cases, documentation burden)?
    *   What are the most rewarding parts of this job at your hospital specifically?
    *   What is the typical nurse-to-patient ratio in your ED? This is a critical question every nurse will ask. Be honest about the range.

### **Part 2: Defining the "Perfect" Candidate (Beyond the Paper)**

4.  **Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves:**
    *   The JD says "2 years of acute care experience; ED experience strongly preferred." How firm is this? Would you consider a rockstar ICU nurse with 3 years of experience but no direct ED experience? Is 1.5 years of strong Level I Trauma ED experience better than 4 years at a small, rural ED? Help me understand the trade-offs.
    *   How critical is the BSN degree? Is the "commitment to complete" a firm requirement, or is it flexible for an amazing candidate with an ADN?
5.  **The "X-Factor" - Soft Skills:** If you had two candidates with identical qualifications, what personality traits or "soft skills" would make one the obvious choice? (e.g., unflappable demeanor, proactive communication, incredible empathy, a "no-task-is-too-small" attitude, dark sense of humor).
6.  **Deal-Breakers:** What are the absolute red flags? (e.g., job-hopping every year, only experience in long-term care/clinics, poor references, seeming overwhelmed by the idea of a fast-paced environment).
7.  **Level I Trauma Context:** Why is the "Level I Trauma" experience so important? Explain it as if I've never heard the term. What does a nurse need to have experienced to be prepared for this?

### **Part 3: The "Sell" - Why Choose Us?**

8.  **The Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** What is the #1 reason a top-tier ED nurse should leave their current job at another hospital to come work for you?
9.  **Growth & Development:** What are the real, tangible career growth opportunities? Can they become a Charge Nurse, a preceptor, join a committee, or move into a leadership role? How long does this typically take?
10. **The "Teaching Hospital" Advantage:** What does being a "teaching hospital" actually mean for a staff nurse? Do they get to see unique cases? Is there more access to education and new technology?
11. **Competitors:** Which other local hospitals are you competing with for this talent? What makes your opportunity better? (e.g., better culture, higher pay, better ratios, newer facility, etc.).

### **Part 4: Logistics of the Recruitment Process**

12. **The Process:** What are the exact steps in your interview process? (e.g., 1. Recruiter Screen, 2. Hiring Manager Phone Call, 3. On-site Peer Interview & Shadowing, 4. Final Offer).
13. **Key Screeners:** What are the top 3 things you want the recruiter to absolutely confirm during their initial screening call with a candidate?
14. **Timeline:** What is your ideal timeline for filling this role? How quickly can you provide feedback on resumes and schedule interviews?

### **Recruitment Brief: Registered Nurse - Emergency Department**

**To Our Recruitment Partner,**

Thank you for partnering with us on this critical search. Our goal is to find an exceptional Registered Nurse for the Emergency Department (ED) at Metropolitan General Hospital. This document is your comprehensive guide to understanding the role, the ideal candidate, and our hospital culture. Please read it carefully, as it contains crucial information beyond the formal job description.

**1. The "Elevator Pitch" - What's the short story?**

"We're looking for a skilled and resilient Emergency Department RN who thrives on organized chaos and wants to work at the highest level of emergency medicine. They'll join a tight-knit, supportive team at the city's premier Level I Trauma Center, where they will handle the most critical cases, grow their skills daily, and be part of a team that feels like family. We're offering a significant $15,000 sign-on bonus and highly competitive pay for the right person."

**2. About Us & The Role (In Simple Terms)**

*   **Who are we?** Metropolitan General Hospital is the city's main hub for emergencies. Think of us as the major league of hospitals in the area.
*   **What does "Level I Trauma Center" mean?** This is the most important thing to understand. It means we are equipped to handle the most severe and life-threatening injuries possible (e.g., major car accidents, gunshot wounds, critical falls). Ambulances and helicopters bring the sickest patients in the region directly to us. This means the pace is fast, the situations are intense, and the medical care is complex. A nurse working here must be prepared for anything.
*   **What does "Teaching Hospital" mean for a nurse?** It means we are a center for learning. Doctors-in-training (residents) and nursing students are always around. For our nurses, this creates a dynamic environment with constant learning, exposure to cutting-edge treatments, and the opportunity to help mentor the next generation.
*   **Why is this role open?** This is a full-time position open due to a combination of team growth and internal promotions. We are getting busier and some of our best nurses have moved up into leadership roles, which is a testament to our focus on career development.

**3. The Team & Culture**

This is not a "lone wolf" role. The ED team is a highly collaborative unit of about 40-50 nurses. They rely on each other completely.

*   **The Vibe:** The culture is built on resilience, teamwork, and a dark sense of humor. It has to be—they see difficult things every day. They are incredibly supportive of one another, both professionally and personally. There's no room for big egos.
*   **The Manager:** The ED Nurse Manager, Sarah Jenkins, is a big selling point. She started as a staff nurse in this very ED. She is on the floor, visible, and fiercely protective of her team. She has high standards but is known for being fair, approachable, and a great mentor.
*   **A Typical Shift:** It's a controlled whirlwind. The nurse will likely care for 3-4 patients at a time, but this can change quickly. One moment they might be helping an elderly person who fell, the next they are part of a massive team response for a trauma patient arriving by helicopter. They will be on their feet for 12 hours, making critical decisions constantly. The biggest challenge is prioritization—figuring out who needs attention *right now*. The biggest reward is seeing a patient who came in near death get stabilized and moved upstairs because of the work the team did.

**4. The Candidate Profile: Must-Haves vs. Ideal**

Your goal is to find someone who is both highly skilled and has the right temperament.

**Part A: The "Must-Have" Candidate (Non-Negotiable Checklist)**

*   **Experience:** At least **2 years of experience as an RN in a busy hospital setting.**
    *   **Priority 1:** Candidates with **at least 1 year of dedicated Emergency Department experience.** This is strongly preferred.
    *   **Priority 2:** Candidates with **2+ years in an ICU (Intensive Care Unit).** These nurses are skilled with very sick patients and can often transition well.
    *   Screen out candidates whose only experience is in nursing homes, clinics, or cosmetic surgery. They will not have the skills for this environment.
*   **License & Education:** A current, active RN license in this state. They must have a Bachelor's of Nursing (BSN) **OR** an Associate's Degree (ADN) with a clear commitment to enroll in a BSN program within a year.
*   **Certifications (The Alphabet Soup Explained):**
    *   **BLS (Basic Life Support):** Everyone needs this. It's CPR.
    *   **ACLS (Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support):** This is for handling adult cardiac emergencies, like a heart attack.
    *   **PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support):** This is for handling life-threatening emergencies in children.
    *   *These three certifications are required at the time of application.* The candidate cannot be considered without them.
*   **Attitude:** They must be able to talk about a time they handled extreme stress and pressure. They should come across as calm, confident, and a team player.

**Part B: The "Ideal" Candidate (What separates good from great)**

*   **Level I Trauma Experience:** They've worked in a similarly busy, high-acuity ED before. They won't be shocked by the pace or severity of our cases.
*   **Key Certifications:** They already have their **TNCC (Trauma Nursing Core Course)** and/or **CEN (Certified Emergency Nurse)**. This shows a deep commitment to emergency nursing.
*   **"The X-Factor" Personality:** They are unflappable. They can juggle five things at once without getting visibly frustrated. They communicate clearly and concisely. They ask for help when they need it and jump in to help others without being asked. They have a positive attitude, even on tough days.
*   **Bilingual:** Spanish-speaking skills are a huge plus for our patient population but not a requirement.

**5. Key Terms to Understand**

*   **Triage / ESI (Emergency Severity Index):** This is how nurses decide who gets seen first. ESI is a 1-to-5 scale. Level 1 is most critical (e.g., cardiac arrest), Level 5 is least urgent (e.g., needs a prescription refill). We need someone who can make these judgments quickly and accurately.
*   **Epic EMR:** This is the brand name of our Electronic Medical Record software, like Salesforce is for sales. Experience with Epic is a huge plus as it shortens their training time.
*   **Trauma Activation / Code:** This is an "all hands on deck" alert for a major trauma. The candidate should be comfortable working as part of a large, fast-moving team.
*   **Preceptor:** An experienced nurse who trains and mentors a new nurse. We're looking for people who have the potential to do this.

**6. The "Sell" - Why They Should Join Us**

This is what you use to attract top talent.

*   **The Mission:** "Work at the top of your license. You will use every skill you have and learn new ones every day. The cases you see here, you won't see anywhere else."
*   **The Team:** "You will be joining a highly skilled, supportive team that has your back. It’s a demanding job, but you will never be alone in it."
*   **Compensation:** We are very competitive. The $38-$52/hr range is strong, and the **$15,000 sign-on bonus** is a huge incentive. Don't forget the **shift differentials** ($5/hr for nights, $3/hr for weekends) which add up significantly.
*   **Growth:** We are a large teaching hospital with clear career ladders. A great nurse can become a Charge Nurse, Preceptor, or join a specialty team (like trauma or stroke) within 2-3 years. We also offer generous tuition reimbursement ($5,250/year) for them to get advanced degrees.

**7. Red Flags & Who to Avoid**

*   **Job Hoppers:** Candidates who have changed jobs every 12-18 months. This team is built on stability.
*   **Poor Communicators:** If they are vague, struggle to answer questions, or sound flustered on the phone with you, they will not succeed here.
*   **"That's Not My Job" Attitude:** We need team players who are willing to help with any task to ensure patient safety.

**8. The Hiring Process**

1.  **Your Screen:** Initial screen for must-haves, salary expectations, and cultural fit.
2.  **Phone Interview:** A 30-minute call with the ED Nurse Manager, Sarah Jenkins.
3.  **On-Site Interview:** A 2-3 hour visit that includes:
    *   A formal interview with Sarah Jenkins.
    *   A peer interview with 2-3 experienced nurses from the team.
    *   A short tour of the department.
4.  **Reference Checks:** We require two references from previous supervisors.
5.  **Offer:** We move quickly for the right candidates. Expect a 2-3 week process from resume submission to offer.

Thank you again for your partnership. Please reach out with any questions. We are excited to see the candidates you find.
