Of course. This is an excellent approach. A great brief is the foundation of a successful search. Before I create the final, comprehensive brief for your recruiter, I need to get inside your head and understand the nuances that aren't in the job description.

Please answer the following questions. Your answers will allow me to translate the corporate jargon into a clear, compelling story that will empower your recruiter to find the perfect candidate.

### **Questions to Build the Recruiter Brief**

**1. The "Why" Behind the Role:**
*   Why is this position open? Is it a new role created due to growth, or is it a backfill for someone who left or was promoted? (This helps the recruiter frame the opportunity.)
*   What is the biggest challenge the person in this role will need to solve in their first 6-12 months? (e.g., "Our forecasting process is too manual and slow," or "We need better insights into the Cloud division's profitability.")

**2. The Team and Manager:**
*   Who is the hiring manager? What is their title? (e.g., Director of FP&A, VP of Finance)
*   How would you describe the hiring manager's leadership style? Are they hands-on, a mentor, data-driven, etc.?
*   How large is the Corporate FP&A team? How many Senior Analysts, Analysts, etc.?
*   What is the team's culture like? Is it heads-down and analytical, highly collaborative, fast-paced and demanding?

**3. The "Must-Haves" vs. "Nice-to-Haves" (Let's Get Specific):**
*   The JD says 5-7 years of experience. Is this a firm rule? Could you consider a rockstar with 4 years of highly relevant experience? What about someone with 8-9 years who is still hands-on?
*   How critical is experience in a **publicly traded** company? Is it a deal-breaker? What specific skill comes from that experience that you're looking for (e.g., understanding of earnings cycles, SOX compliance)?
*   You list several financial planning tools (Adaptive, Anaplan, Hyperion). Is experience with one of these absolutely mandatory, or is experience with *any* modern planning tool sufficient? Is there a preference?
*   Similarly, for ERPs (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite), is experience with one of these a must-have, or is general familiarity with large-scale ERPs okay?
*   How important is the SaaS/tech industry background? Would you consider a strong candidate from another fast-paced industry like CPG, retail, or media?
*   The role partners with the Cloud Services division. Does the ideal candidate *need* to have experience with cloud or SaaS business models (e.g., understanding metrics like ARR, Churn, CAC, LTV)?

**4. The Day-to-Day Reality:**
*   What will this person spend most of their time doing? Is it 70% in Excel building models, 20% in PowerPoint creating presentations, and 10% in meetings? Or a different mix?
*   How much "business partnering" is there really? Will they be in meetings with VPs and General Managers every week?
*   You mention M&A support. How frequent are acquisitions? Is this a core part of the job or an occasional project?

**5. Candidate Profile & Red Flags:**
*   What are the top 3 things that would make a candidate stand out? (e.g., "They can not only build a model but can also explain the 'so what' to a non-finance executive.")
*   What would be an immediate red flag on a resume or in an interview? (e.g., "A pure accounting background with no forward-looking analysis," or "Job hopping every 12 months.")

**6. The Interview Process:**
*   What are the specific steps in the interview process? (e.g., 1. Recruiter Screen, 2. Hiring Manager Interview, 3. Excel Modeling Test, 4. Panel Interview with business partners and team members, 5. Final interview with VP of Finance).
*   Is there a case study or modeling test? If so, what does it involve? (e.g., "We give them raw data and ask them to build a 3-statement model and a few summary slides.")

Once you provide these details, I will synthesize them with the job description to create the perfect brief.

## **Recruiter Brief: Senior Financial Analyst - Corporate FP&A**

**Prepared for: [Recruiter's Name]**
**Date: [Date]**

Hi [Recruiter's Name],

Thank you for partnering with us on this critical search. This document is your guide to finding the perfect Senior Financial Analyst for our Corporate FP&A team. Please read it carefully, as it goes beyond the formal job description to give you the inside story of the role, the team, and what "great" looks like.

### 1. The Elevator Pitch (What to tell candidates)

"I'm recruiting for a Senior Financial Analyst at TechCorp, a fast-growing, publicly-traded tech company in Austin. This isn't a typical analyst role where you're just stuck in spreadsheets. You'll be a true business partner, working directly with executives in the high-growth Cloud division and presenting your analysis to the C-suite. The company is up 25% year-over-year, and this role was created specifically to support that growth, meaning you'll have a direct impact on major business decisions. If you're looking to influence strategy at a multi-billion dollar company and want a role with a clear path for career advancement, this is it."

### 2. About the Company & The Role (In Simple Terms)

*   **What we do:** TechCorp is a $2.5 billion technology company. Think of us as having three main businesses: we sell software to large companies (Enterprise Software), we provide internet-based computing power and storage (Cloud Services), and we sell physical tech products (Hardware). We're growing very quickly.
*   **What this role is:** This person is a financial detective and storyteller. They don't just report the numbers (that's accounting); they use the numbers to predict the future and help our leaders make smarter decisions. They will be the go-to finance expert for our Cloud Services division, which is our fastest-growing business unit.

### 3. Decoding the Jargon (Key Terms Explained)

Your candidates will know these, but this is for your understanding:

*   **FP&A (Financial Planning & Analysis):** This is the team that manages the company's budget, creates financial forecasts (predicting future revenue and expenses), and analyzes business performance. **Analogy:** If accounting is the rearview mirror (what already happened), FP&A is the GPS and dashboard (where we are going and how fast).
*   **Corporate FP&A:** This is the main, central FP&A team. They look at the entire company's financial health and report directly to the top executives (CEO, CFO).
*   **Variance Analysis:** This means comparing our plan (the budget) to what *actually* happened and explaining *why* there's a difference. (e.g., "We beat our revenue forecast by $5M because a new product sold better than expected.")
*   **Financial Model:** A complex spreadsheet (usually in Excel) that uses a set of assumptions to forecast a company's future financial performance. It's a tool for "what-if" questions.
*   **Business Partner:** This means the analyst doesn't just sit in the finance department. They are embedded with a business team (in this case, Cloud Services) to act as their dedicated finance advisor.
*   **ERP (SAP, Oracle):** The giant, central software system that runs a company's financials. Think of it as the master database for all money-related transactions.
*   **Planning Tools (Anaplan, Adaptive):** Specialized software built for budgeting and forecasting. It's more powerful and collaborative than using just Excel for planning.

### 4. The Ideal Candidate Profile

This is the most important section. We need someone who is both technically sharp and a great communicator.

**Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable):**

1.  **Strong FP&A Foundation (4-7 years):** They must have solid experience in a corporate finance or FP&A role. They need to have lived through budget cycles and forecasting processes before. We are flexible on the 5-year minimum for a true superstar from a top company.
2.  **Advanced Excel Modeling Skills:** This is a deal-breaker. They must be able to build complex financial models from scratch. You can screen for this by asking: *"Tell me about the most complex model you've built. What business question did it answer?"*
3.  **Excellent Communication & Storytelling:** They will be presenting to executives. They must be able to take complex data and explain the "so what" in a simple, clear way. They can't just present numbers; they have to provide insights.
4.  **Experience with a Modern Planning Tool:** While we list specific names, the key is that they have used a tool like Anaplan, Adaptive Insights, or Hyperion. This shows they can work beyond Excel. Ask which ones they've used.

**Strongly Preferred (The "A+" Candidate):**

*   **Public Company Experience:** This is a big plus because they will understand the pressure and rhythm of quarterly earnings reports.
*   **Tech/SaaS Industry Background:** Candidates from tech/SaaS companies will already know the key metrics (like CAC, LTV, ARR) and the business model. This will significantly reduce their ramp-up time. Prioritize these candidates.
*   **Business Partnering Experience:** Have they worked directly with non-finance leaders (like Heads of Sales, Marketing, or Product)?
*   **Ambitious & Proactive Attitude:** We want someone who sees a problem and wants to fix it, not someone who waits to be told what to do.

### 5. Candidate Red Flags (What to Avoid)

Please screen these candidates out to save everyone time:

*   **Pure Accountants:** Candidates whose experience is 90% accounting (month-end close, journal entries) are not a fit. This is a forward-looking, strategic role.
*   **Poor Communicators:** If they can't clearly explain their experience or the impact of their work to you, they will fail in front of our executives.
*   **"Data Dumper":** Candidates who can pull data but can't explain what it means. We need insights, not just reports.
*   **Only from Slow, Non-Tech Industries:** A candidate from a very slow-moving, stable industry (like manufacturing or government) may struggle with our pace and ambiguity.

### 6. The Team, Culture, and Opportunity

*   **Hiring Manager:** Jane Doe, Director of Corporate FP&A. Jane is a fantastic leader who started as an analyst herself. She is a great mentor who believes in giving her team a lot of responsibility and visibility.
*   **Team Structure:** The Corporate FP&A team has 8 people. This role will be one of three Senior Analysts.
*   **Reason for Opening:** This is a **brand-new position** created because of company growth. This isn't a backfill. The candidate will get to shape the role and won't be living in someone else's shadow.
*   **Career Path:** Success in this role leads to a Manager position within 2-3 years, either on the Corporate team or within one of the business units. We have a strong track record of promoting from within.

### 7. Key Screening Questions for You to Ask

1.  "Walk me through your experience with the annual budget process. What was your specific role in it?"
2.  "Tell me about a time you presented a financial analysis to a senior leader. What was the topic, and what was the outcome of your recommendation?"
3.  "This role partners with our Cloud division. What experience do you have with SaaS or subscription-based business models?"
4.  "What financial planning software (like Anaplan, Hyperion, etc.) and ERP systems (like SAP, Oracle) have you used?"
5.  "What are you looking for in your next role that you aren't getting in your current one?" (Listen for words like "impact," "strategy," "visibility," and "growth.")

### 8. Logistics

*   **Interview Process:**
    1.  **Your Screen:** (30 mins)
    2.  **Hiring Manager Interview:** Jane Doe (45 mins) - Focus on experience and team fit.
    3.  **Excel Modeling Test:** (Take-home, 2-3 hours) - We'll provide a data set and ask them to build a forecast and a summary presentation.
    4.  **Panel Interview:** (2 x 45 mins) - Meet with another FP&A team member and the VP of Strategy for the Cloud division.
    5.  **Final Interview:** John Smith, VP of Finance (30 mins)
*   **Location:** Hybrid in Austin, Texas. We expect people in the office Tuesday-Thursday.
*   **Compensation:** The base range is firm at $130k-$160k. The total package (with bonus and equity) is very competitive. We want top talent and are prepared to pay for it.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I'm excited to see the candidates you find
