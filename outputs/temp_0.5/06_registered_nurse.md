Absolutely! To create the most comprehensive and clear recruiter brief, I need to clarify a few details and get your input on some points. Please answer the following questions to help me tailor the brief perfectly for your external recruiter:

---

### 1. **Location & Candidate Pool**
- **Where is Metropolitan General Hospital located?** (City, state, and any relevant info about the local area)
- **Are you open to candidates relocating from out of state?** Is relocation assistance only for out-of-state or also for those moving within the state?
- **Is remote or hybrid work ever possible, or is this strictly on-site?**

---

### 2. **Licensing & Certifications**
- **Does the RN license need to be from a specific state?** Or will you consider candidates eligible for endorsement/reciprocity?
- **Will you consider candidates who are in the process of obtaining required certifications (like TNCC), or must they already have them?**
- **Are there any certifications that are “nice to have” but not required? (e.g., CEN, ENPC, Spanish language proficiency)**

---

### 3. **Experience**
- **Are you open to considering candidates with less than 2 years of acute care experience if they have strong ER experience, or is the 2-year minimum strict?**
- **How important is previous Level I Trauma Center experience?** Is it a must-have or a strong preference?
- **Would you consider candidates with only pediatric or only adult ED experience?**
- **Is preceptor or charge nurse experience required, or only preferred?**

---

### 4. **Shift Preferences**
- **Do you have a preference for day shift or night shift hires at this time?**
- **Are there certain shifts that are more difficult to fill and should be prioritized?**
- **How much flexibility is there on the shift schedule, or is it strictly as posted?**

---

### 5. **Compensation & Benefits**
- **Is the posted hourly rate firm, or is there flexibility for exceptional candidates?**
- **Is the sign-on bonus paid out immediately or over time? Are there any “clawback” provisions if the candidate leaves early?**
- **Can you specify what “relocation assistance” covers? (e.g., moving expenses, temporary housing, etc.)**
- **Any other unique benefits or perks that should be highlighted to attract candidates?**

---

### 6. **Team & Culture**
- **How large is the Emergency Department nursing team?**
- **What is the nurse-to-patient ratio?**
- **What is the management/support structure like? (e.g., charge nurses, clinical educators, etc.)**
- **Is there anything special about your team culture, values, or approach to care that candidates should know?**

### 7. **Process & Timeline**

- **What is the expected time to hire?**
- **Are there any background checks, drug screens, or other pre-employment requirements?**
- **Who should the recruiter send candidates to, and what is your preferred method of communication?**

---

### 8. **Candidate Red Flags**
- **Are there any backgrounds or gaps that would be automatic disqualifiers? (e.g., recent disciplinary action, long gaps in employment, etc.)**
- **Are you open to candidates with international experience, or must all experience be US-based?**

---

### 9. **Other Must-Knows**
- **Any unique challenges about the role or location that the recruiter should be aware of?**

**Once you provide these details, I’ll create a comprehensive, step-by-step recruiter brief in plain English, explaining all technical terms and requirements.**
