Absolutely! Before I create the comprehensive recruiter brief, I need to make sure I have all the information needed to make this as clear, thorough, and recruiter-friendly as possible. Here are the questions I’d like you to answer. Please be as detailed as you can—this will help ensure your external recruiter can find the right candidates.
