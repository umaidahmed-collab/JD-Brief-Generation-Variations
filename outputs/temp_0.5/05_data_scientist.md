Absolutely! To create a comprehensive recruiter brief that’s clear, detailed, and non-technical, I’ll need to ask you some clarifying questions first. This will ensure the brief covers everything a recruiter needs to understand the company, the role, what a great candidate looks like, and how to pitch the opportunity.

**Please answer the following questions:**

---

### 1. **Company & Team Context**
- What is the size of the company and the Risk Analytics team?
- Who does this role report to (title/position)?
- Are there any direct reports or is this an individual contributor role?
- What is the company culture like? (e.g., fast-paced, collaborative, innovative)
- Are there any recent milestones, press, or awards that make the company stand out?

---

### 2. **Role Purpose & Impact**
- Why is this role open? (New headcount, backfill, growth, etc.)
- What are the top 2-3 business objectives this person will directly impact?
- What does success look like in this role after 6-12 months?

### 3. **Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have Skills**
- Which technical skills are absolutely required, and which are “nice to have”?
- Are there any certifications or specific degrees required, or will equivalent experience suffice?
