Absolutely! To create a truly comprehensive, recruiter-friendly brief, I’ll need to clarify a few details and make sure we cover everything your recruiter might need—especially since they’re external, non-technical, and unfamiliar with your company and the HRBP role in a tech context.

**Questions for You (Please answer as many as possible):**

1. **Company Context & Culture:**
   - What is GlobalTech’s mission and core values?
   - What is the company culture like? (Collaborative, fast-paced, innovative, etc.)
   - Are there any unique perks, traditions, or selling points?
   - Are there any recent or upcoming organizational changes (e.g., acquisitions, restructures) relevant to this role?

2. **Team & Stakeholders:**
   - Who does this HRBP report to?
   - Who are the key stakeholders (e.g., VPs, managers) this person will work with most closely?
   - How big are the Engineering and Product teams they’ll support? What is their structure (on-site, remote, global)?
   - Are there other HRBPs or HR team members? How do they collaborate?

3. **Role Priorities & Success:**
   - What are the top 3 priorities for this HRBP in the first 6–12 months?
   - What would a “successful” first year look like?
   - Are there any current pain points or challenges this HRBP will need to address right away?

4. **Candidate Profile:**
   - Are you open to candidates from outside the tech industry if they have strong HRBP experience?
   - Is experience with global teams or remote work a must, or just nice-to-have?
   - Is Workday experience required, or will other HRIS experience suffice?
   - Are you open to candidates outside the Bay Area if they are willing to travel occasionally?

5. **Process & Logistics:**
   - What is your interview process (stages, panel, assessments)?
   - Any “dealbreaker” requirements (e.g., must have managed employee relations investigations end-to-end)?
   - What is your timeline for hiring?
   - Who will make the final hiring decision?

6. **Additional Info:**
   - Any companies you’d particularly like to see candidates from (or avoid)?
   - Any certifications or education you consider essential vs. preferred?
   - Is there flexibility on compensation for an exceptional candidate?
   - Any specific diversity or inclusion goals for this hire?

**Once you provide this info, I’ll draft a clear, comprehensive recruiter brief.**
