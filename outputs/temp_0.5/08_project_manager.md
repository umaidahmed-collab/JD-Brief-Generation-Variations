Absolutely! To create the most effective and comprehensive recruiter brief, I will first ask you a series of clarifying questions. Your answers will help ensure that the brief is detailed, clear, and tailored for a non-technical external recruiter who may not know your company, your industry, or construction terminology.

**Clarifying Questions**

**1. Company & Role Context**
- How would you describe your company’s culture and values? (e.g., collaborative, fast-paced, safety-focused, etc.)
- What is the reporting structure for this position? Who does the Senior Project Manager report to, and who reports to them?
- Why is this position open (growth, backfill, new projects, etc.)?
- What are the top 2-3 things you want this person to achieve in their first year?
- Are there any unique challenges or opportunities about this role or your projects that candidates should know?

**2. Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have**
- Of all the qualifications and skills listed, which are absolutely required, and which are preferred but not essential?
- Are you open to candidates from outside your region, or is local experience in the Southwest a must?
- Are there specific project types (healthcare, education, etc.) or client types that are most important for experience?
- Is experience with certain software (Procore, Primavera P6, Bluebeam) a deal-breaker, or can you train a strong candidate?

**3. Candidate Profile**
- What size of projects has your ideal candidate managed in the past?
- What is the typical size and composition of the teams they’ve led?
- Are there certain companies, competitors, or backgrounds that produce the best candidates for this role?

**4. Logistics & Compensation**
- Is there any flexibility in salary or benefits for an exceptional candidate?
- Will relocation assistance be provided if the candidate is not local?
- Is remote or hybrid work possible, or is the role fully onsite or at project sites?
- What is the interview process and expected timeline?

**5. Dealbreakers/Red Flags**
- Are there any backgrounds or experiences that are NOT a fit (e.g., only residential experience, only small project experience, etc.)?
