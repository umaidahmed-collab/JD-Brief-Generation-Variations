To create a truly comprehensive and recruiter-friendly brief, I’ll need to clarify several points about the role, your company, the working context, must-haves versus nice-to-haves, and any practical or cultural fit elements.

## Company Overview
Division50 is a [describe in 1-2 lines what the company does, in plain English]. We are a [startup/scale-up/established company] of [number] people, building [product/service] for [target customers/market]. Our culture is [brief description: e.g., fast-paced, founder-led, remote-first, low bureaucracy, etc.].

## The Mission
We're looking for a [Job Title] to take full technical ownership of our AI-powered SaaS platform, D50 AI. This is not a brand-new project, but an existing system that needs to be stabilized, cleaned up, and made reliable for real users.

**Key goals:**
- Understand and stabilize the current platform (inheriting imperfect code and partial documentation)
- Ensure all integrations (AI, telephony, CRM, frontend) are robust and production-ready
- Set up cloud environments and monitoring for reliability
- Document the system so others can maintain it in the future

## Who This Role Is For
- Someone who loves digging into messy systems and making them stable and reliable
- Enjoys figuring things out, not just following perfect plans
- Is proactive, hands-on, and comfortable working directly with founders
- Prefers action over theory

## What You'll Do (in plain English)
- Take over the existing SaaS tech platform and learn how everything works, even if it's not perfectly documented
- Fix issues in the codebase so users can onboard and use it without things breaking
- Manage all technical integrations—including AI tools (like OpenAI for text/images, ElevenLabs for voice, Deepgram for speech-to-text, HeyGen for video), as well as phone call systems (Twilio/Telnyx)
- Make sure all data (calls, recordings, CRM info) is stored and tracked correctly
- Maintain and improve the user dashboard (built with React or similar)
- Set up and maintain cloud infrastructure (AWS), including deployment, monitoring, and cost optimization
- Write clear documentation so the next engineer can understand the system

## Key Technical Skills (absolute must-haves)
- Strong programming experience in Node.js **or** Python (one deeply; both a plus)
- Experience with APIs, async systems, and handling system failures/retries
- Experience with MongoDB (designing schemas for CRM/logging, not just basic usage)
- Experience maintaining production web frontends (React or similar)
- Experience managing cloud environments (preferably AWS)
- Experience with Docker or similar containerization tools
- Experience with CI/CD basics (e.g., GitHub Actions)

## Other Key Skills (strongly preferred, but not all required)
- Experience integrating AI APIs (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, HeyGen)
- Experience with AI workflow tools (Langflow, LangChain, or similar)
- Understanding of telephony systems (Twilio, Telnyx), call flows, and related concepts
- Experience stabilizing messy codebases or MVPs
- Experience working directly with founders or in small, fast-moving teams

## Nice-to-Haves
- Experience with SaaS billing systems
- Experience documenting and transferring knowledge
- Experience working in startups

## Candidate Profile - Best Fit
- Independent, self-motivated, takes initiative
- Enjoys untangling and fixing complex systems
- Comfortable with ambiguity, incomplete specs, and working directly with decision-makers
- Strong communicator, especially in documentation

## Logistics
- Fully remote
- [Time zone/location requirements, if any]
- [Salary range, if available]
- [Interview process outline]

## Red Flags
- Only comfortable working with clean, well-documented systems
- Only wants to work on new "greenfield" projects
- Lacks hands-on experience with at least one major backend language (Node.js or Python)
- No experience with MongoDB or similar NoSQL databases
