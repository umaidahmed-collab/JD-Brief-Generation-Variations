Absolutely! To create the most effective and easy-to-understand recruiter brief, I’ll need to clarify several things to ensure all important details and context are covered—especially for an external recruiter who may not know your company, tech industry, or HR/people function specifics.

**Please answer the following clarifying questions (you can copy-paste and fill in):**

---

### 1. **About the Company & Team**
- How would you describe GlobalTech Solutions’ culture and values in plain English?
- What’s the management style of the leaders the HRBP will support (VP Engineering, VP Product)? Any specific personalities or approaches to flag?
- What are the company’s big challenges or goals this HRBP should help with (e.g., hyper-growth, retention, culture change, international expansion)?
- Who will the HRBP report to (title and location)?
- How large is the HR team, and who will this HRBP work closely with?
- How would you describe the Engineering and Product organizations? (e.g., mostly software engineers, diverse teams, distributed, etc.)

### 2. **Role Context**
- Why is this role open? (new headcount, backfill, internal move, etc.)
- What are the top 3 priorities for this HRBP in the first 6-12 months?
- Are there any key projects or changes coming up (e.g., M&A, re-org, major hiring push)?
- What are the common challenges this HRBP will face (e.g., remote team management, high turnover, performance issues)?

### 3. **Candidate Profile**
- Must they have experience in enterprise software/technology, or are adjacent industries okay?
- Are you open to candidates from non-tech companies if they’ve supported technical teams?
- Is experience with global teams required, or just a plus?
- Any specific HR systems/tools experience required beyond Workday (e.g., Greenhouse, SAP)?
- What HR certifications are must-have, nice-to-have, or not necessary?
- Are there specific “red flags” in backgrounds you want to avoid?
- Any companies or industries you love/hate to see on a resume?

### 4. **Soft Skills & Success Traits**
- What personal qualities are critical (e.g., resilience, diplomacy, bias for action)?
- How important is prior experience influencing senior technical leaders?
- Are you looking for a “hands-on” HRBP or someone more strategic/consultative?
- What does success look like in this role after the first year?

### 5. **Logistics**
- What are the MUST HAVES vs NICE TO HAVES (be specific)?
- Is the salary range flexible for the right candidate?
- Is remote truly okay, or do you have a strong preference for Bay Area candidates?
- Will you sponsor visas now or in the future?

**Once you answer these questions, I’ll build a comprehensive, recruiter-friendly brief that uses simple, non-technical language, explains any technical terms, and gives your recruiter all the context needed to find the best candidates.**
