Absolutely! To create the most effective brief for your external, non-technical recruiter, I will need to clarify a few important areas. Please answer the following questions to help me tailor the brief:

---

## COMPANY & TEAM CONTEXT

1. **What does your company do in one or two sentences, in very simple terms?**  
   (e.g., “We build software that helps banks decide who they should give loans to.”)

2. **What is the Risk Analytics team responsible for, and how does this role fit into that team?**  
   (e.g., “This team builds tools and models that help our clients avoid bad loans and catch fraud before it happens.”)

3. **Who does this person report to, and what other roles are on the team?**

---

## ROLE CLARIFICATION

4. **What are the top 3-5 most important things this person needs to do in the first 6-12 months?**  
   (e.g., “Build a new credit risk model for a large bank client.”)

5. **Which of the listed responsibilities are ‘must-haves’ vs. ‘nice-to-haves’?**  
   (e.g., Is NLP experience essential, or just a bonus?)

6. **Is direct experience in financial services a requirement, or just preferred?**

7. **Are you open to candidates from other domains if they have strong machine learning experience?**

---

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

8. **Of the technical skills, which ones are absolute must-haves?**  
   (e.g., “Must have Python, SQL, and experience with XGBoost or LightGBM.”)

9. **Are there any platforms/tools you use daily that candidates should already know, or is some ramp-up time OK?**

10. **Is experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) required, or can someone learn on the job?**

11. **How much ‘hands-on coding’ is involved vs. leadership/mentoring?**

12. **How important is experience with very large datasets (billions of records)?**

---

## SOFT SKILLS & WORK STYLE

13. **What are the key personality traits or soft skills that make someone successful in your team?**  
   (e.g., “Can explain complicated ideas to people who aren’t technical.”)

14. **Is this role more independent or highly collaborative?**

15. **How much client interaction is expected, if any?**

---

## LOGISTICS

16. **Is there a specific time zone or location requirement within the US?**

17. **Are you open to H-1B or other visa holders, or must candidates be US citizens/Green Card holders?**

18. **What is your interview process, and how quickly do you hope to hire?**

---

## ANYTHING ELSE

19. **Is there anything unique about your company culture or benefits that should be highlighted to attract candidates?**

20. **Are there any companies or industries where you’ve found good candidates in the past?**

**Please answer as many questions as you can.**  
Once you reply, I’ll prepare a comprehensive, recruiter-friendly brief that explains exactly who you’re looking for and how to find them, using simple language and clear guidance.
